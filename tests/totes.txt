AN INTERNET MEME (/ˈMIːM/ MEEM) IS AN ACTIVITY, CONCEPT, CATCHPHRASE
OR PIECE OF MEDIA WHICH SPREADS, OFTEN AS MIMICRY, FROM PERSON TO
PERSON VIA THE INTERNET.[1] SOME NOTABLE EXAMPLES INCLUDE POSTING A
PHOTO OF PEOPLE LYING DOWN IN PUBLIC PLACES (CALLED "PLANKING") AND
UPLOADING A SHORT VIDEO OF PEOPLE DANCING TO THE HARLEM SHAKE.

A MEME IS "AN IDEA, BEHAVIOR, OR STYLE THAT SPREADS FROM PERSON TO
PERSON WITHIN A CULTURE".[2] AN INTERNET MEME MAY TAKE THE FORM OF AN
IMAGE, HYPERLINK, VIDEO, PICTURE, WEBSITE, OR HASHTAG. IT MAY BE JUST
A WORD OR PHRASE, INCLUDING AN INTENTIONAL MISSPELLING. THESE SMALL
MOVEMENTS TEND TO SPREAD FROM PERSON TO PERSON VIA SOCIAL NETWORKS,
BLOGS, DIRECT EMAIL, OR NEWS SOURCES. THEY MAY RELATE TO VARIOUS
EXISTING INTERNET CULTURES OR SUBCULTURES, OFTEN CREATED OR SPREAD ON
SITES SUCH AS REDDIT, TUMBLR AND NUMEROUS OTHERS, OR BY USENET BOARDS
AND OTHER SUCH EARLY-INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES. FADS AND
SENSATIONS TEND TO GROW RAPIDLY ON THE INTERNET, BECAUSE THE INSTANT
COMMUNICATION FACILITATES WORD-OF-MOUTH TRANSMISSION.

THE WORD MEME WAS COINED BY RICHARD DAWKINS IN HIS 1976 BOOK THE
SELFISH GENE, AS AN ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN THE WAY CULTURAL INFORMATION
SPREADS;[3] INTERNET MEMES ARE A SUBSET OF THIS GENERAL MEME CONCEPT
SPECIFIC TO THE CULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT OF THE INTERNET. IN 2013
DAWKINS CHARACTERIZED AN INTERNET MEME AS BEING A MEME DELIBERATELY
ALTERED BY HUMAN CREATIVITY—DISTINGUISHED FROM BIOLOGICAL GENES AND
DAWKINS' PRE-INTERNET CONCEPT OF A MEME WHICH INVOLVED MUTATION BY
RANDOM CHANGE AND SPREADING THROUGH ACCURATE REPLICATION AS IN
DARWINIAN SELECTION.[4] DAWKINS EXPLAINED THAT INTERNET MEMES ARE THUS
A "HIJACKING OF THE ORIGINAL IDEA," THE VERY IDEA OF A MEME HAVING
MUTATED AND EVOLVED IN THIS NEW DIRECTION.[5] FURTHER, INTERNET MEMES
CARRY AN ADDITIONAL PROPERTY THAT ORDINARY MEMES DO NOT—INTERNET MEMES
LEAVE A FOOTPRINT IN THE MEDIA THROUGH WHICH THEY PROPAGATE (FOR
EXAMPLE, SOCIAL NETWORKS) THAT RENDERS THEM TRACEABLE AND
ANALYZABLE.[6]

INTERNET MEMES ARE A SUBSET THAT SUSAN BLACKMORE CALLED TEMES—MEMES
WHICH LIVE IN TECHNOLOGICAL ARTIFACTS INSTEAD OF THE HUMAN MIND.[7]

IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE INTERNET, SUCH CONTENT WAS PRIMARILY SPREAD
VIA EMAIL OR USENET DISCUSSION COMMUNITIES. MESSAGEBOARDS AND
NEWSGROUPS WERE ALSO POPULAR BECAUSE THEY ALLOWED A SIMPLE METHOD FOR
PEOPLE TO SHARE INFORMATION OR MEMES WITH A DIVERSE POPULATION OF
INTERNET USERS IN A SHORT PERIOD. THEY ENCOURAGE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN
PEOPLE, AND THUS BETWEEN MEME SETS, THAT DO NOT NORMALLY COME IN
CONTACT. FURTHERMORE, THEY ACTIVELY PROMOTE MEME-SHARING WITHIN THE
MESSAGEBOARD OR NEWSGROUP POPULATION BY ASKING FOR FEEDBACK, COMMENTS,
OPINIONS, ETC. THIS FORMAT IS WHAT GAVE RISE TO EARLY INTERNET MEMES,
LIKE THE HAMPSTER DANCE.[CITATION NEEDED] ANOTHER FACTOR IN THE
INCREASED MEME TRANSMISSION OBSERVED OVER THE INTERNET IS ITS
INTERACTIVE NATURE. PRINT MATTER, RADIO, AND TELEVISION ARE ALL
ESSENTIALLY PASSIVE EXPERIENCES REQUIRING THE READER, LISTENER, OR
VIEWER TO PERFORM ALL NECESSARY COGNITIVE PROCESSING; IN CONTRAST THE
SOCIAL NATURE OF THE INTERNET ALLOWS PHENOMENA TO PROPAGATE MORE
READILY. MANY PHENOMENA ARE ALSO SPREAD VIA WEB SEARCH ENGINES,
INTERNET FORUMS, SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICES, SOCIAL NEWS SITES, AND
VIDEO HOSTING SERVICES. MUCH OF THE INTERNET'S ABILITY TO SPREAD
INFORMATION IS ASSISTED FROM RESULTS FOUND THROUGH SEARCH ENGINES,
WHICH CAN ALLOW USERS TO FIND MEMES EVEN WITH OBSCURE
INFORMATION.[8][9]

EVOLUTION AND PROPAGATION[EDIT] AN INTERNET MEME MAY STAY THE SAME OR
MAY EVOLVE OVER TIME, BY CHANCE OR THROUGH COMMENTARY, IMITATIONS,
PARODY, OR BY INCORPORATING NEWS ACCOUNTS ABOUT ITSELF. ADVICE DOG IS
ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS TYPES OF THESE BY GIVING RISE TO THE ADVICE
ANIMAL IMAGE MACROS THAT ARE KNOWN TODAY.[CITATION NEEDED] INTERNET
MEMES CAN EVOLVE AND SPREAD EXTREMELY RAPIDLY, SOMETIMES REACHING
WORLD-WIDE POPULARITY WITHIN A FEW DAYS. INTERNET MEMES USUALLY ARE
FORMED FROM SOME SOCIAL INTERACTION, POP CULTURE REFERENCE, OR
SITUATIONS PEOPLE OFTEN FIND THEMSELVES IN. THEIR RAPID GROWTH AND
IMPACT HAS CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF BOTH RESEARCHERS AND INDUSTRY.[10]
ACADEMICALLY, RESEARCHERS MODEL HOW THEY EVOLVE AND PREDICT WHICH
MEMES WILL SURVIVE AND SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE WEB. COMMERCIALLY, THEY
ARE USED IN VIRAL MARKETING WHERE THEY ARE AN INEXPENSIVE FORM OF MASS
ADVERTISING.

ONE EMPIRICAL APPROACH STUDIED MEME CHARACTERISTICS AND BEHAVIOR
INDEPENDENTLY FROM THE NETWORKS IN WHICH THEY PROPAGATED, AND REACHED
A SET OF CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING SUCCESSFUL MEME PROPAGATION.[6] FOR
EXAMPLE, THE STUDY ASSERTED THAT INTERNET MEMES NOT ONLY COMPETE FOR
VIEWER ATTENTION GENERALLY RESULTING IN A SHORTER LIFE, BUT ALSO,
THROUGH USER CREATIVITY, MEMES CAN COLLABORATE WITH EACH OTHER AND
ACHIEVE GREATER SURVIVAL.[6] ALSO, PARADOXICALLY, AN INDIVIDUAL MEME
THAT EXPERIENCES A POPULARITY PEAK SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN ITS
AVERAGE POPULARITY IS NOT GENERALLY EXPECTED TO SURVIVE UNLESS IT IS
UNIQUE, WHEREAS A MEME WITH NO SUCH POPULARITY PEAK KEEPS BEING USED
TOGETHER WITH OTHER MEMES AND THUS HAS GREATER SURVIVABILITY.[6]

WRITING FOR THE WASHINGTON POST IN 2013, DOMINIC BASULTO ASSERTED THAT
WITH THE GROWTH OF THE INTERNET AND THE PRACTICES OF THE MARKETING AND
ADVERTISING INDUSTRIES, MEMES HAVE COME TO TRANSMIT FEWER SNIPPETS OF
HUMAN CULTURE THAT COULD SURVIVE FOR CENTURIES AS ORIGINALLY
ENVISIONED BY DAWKINS, AND INSTEAD TRANSMIT BANALITY AT THE EXPENSE OF
BIG IDEAS.[11]

MARKETING[EDIT] PUBLIC RELATIONS, ADVERTISING, AND MARKETING
PROFESSIONALS HAVE EMBRACED INTERNET MEMES AS A FORM OF VIRAL
MARKETING AND GUERRILLA MARKETING TO CREATE MARKETING "BUZZ" FOR THEIR
PRODUCT OR SERVICE. THE PRACTICE OF USING MEMES TO MARKET PRODUCTS OR
SERVICES IS KNOWN AS MEMETIC MARKETING.[12] INTERNET MEMES ARE SEEN AS
COST-EFFECTIVE, AND BECAUSE THEY ARE A (SOMETIMES SELF-CONSCIOUS) FAD,
THEY ARE THEREFORE USED AS A WAY TO CREATE AN IMAGE OF AWARENESS OR
TRENDINESS.

MARKETERS, FOR EXAMPLE, USE INTERNET MEMES TO CREATE INTEREST IN FILMS
THAT WOULD OTHERWISE NOT GENERATE POSITIVE PUBLICITY AMONG CRITICS.
THE 2006 FILM SNAKES ON A PLANE GENERATED MUCH PUBLICITY VIA THIS
METHOD.[13] USED IN THE CONTEXT OF PUBLIC RELATIONS, THE TERM WOULD BE
MORE OF AN ADVERTISING BUZZWORD THAN A PROPER INTERNET MEME, ALTHOUGH
THERE IS STILL AN IMPLICATION THAT THE INTEREST IN THE CONTENT IS FOR
PURPOSES OF TRIVIA, EPHEMERA, OR FRIVOLITY RATHER THAN STRAIGHTFORWARD
ADVERTISING AND NEWS.[14]

EXAMPLES OF MEMETIC MARKETING INCLUDE THE FREECREDITREPORT.COM SINGING
AD CAMPAIGN, THE "NOPE, CHUCK TESTA" MEME FROM AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR
TAXIDERMIST CHUCK TESTA, AND THE DUMB WAYS TO DIE PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT
AD CAMPAIGN BY METRO TRAINS MELBOURNE.

INFORMATION WHEN YOU VISIT A GOOGLE SERVICE, AND THIS MAY INCLUDE
SENDING ONE OR MORE COOKIES OR ANONYMOUS IDENTIFIERS TO YOUR DEVICE.
WE ALSO USE COOKIES AND ANONYMOUS IDENTIFIERS WHEN YOU INTERACT WITH
SERVICES WE OFFER TO OUR PARTNERS, SUCH AS ADVERTISING SERVICES OR
GOOGLE FEATURES THAT MAY APPEAR ON OTHER SITES.

HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM ALL OF OUR SERVICES TO PROVIDE,
MAINTAIN, PROTECT AND IMPROVE THEM, TO DEVELOP NEW ONES, AND TO
PROTECT GOOGLE AND OUR USERS. WE ALSO USE THIS INFORMATION TO OFFER
YOU TAILORED CONTENT – LIKE GIVING YOU MORE RELEVANT SEARCH RESULTS
AND ADS.

WE MAY USE THE NAME YOU PROVIDE FOR YOUR GOOGLE PROFILE ACROSS ALL OF
THE SERVICES WE OFFER THAT REQUIRE A GOOGLE ACCOUNT. IN ADDITION, WE
MAY REPLACE PAST NAMES ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR GOOGLE ACCOUNT SO THAT YOU
ARE REPRESENTED CONSISTENTLY ACROSS ALL OUR SERVICES. IF OTHER USERS
ALREADY HAVE YOUR EMAIL, OR OTHER INFORMATION THAT IDENTIFIES YOU, WE
MAY SHOW THEM YOUR PUBLICLY VISIBLE GOOGLE PROFILE INFORMATION, SUCH
AS YOUR NAME AND PHOTO.

IF YOU HAVE A GOOGLE ACCOUNT, WE MAY DISPLAY YOUR PROFILE NAME,
PROFILE PHOTO, AND ACTIONS YOU TAKE ON GOOGLE OR ON THIRD-PARTY
APPLICATIONS CONNECTED TO YOUR GOOGLE ACCOUNT (SUCH AS +1’S, REVIEWS
YOU WRITE AND COMMENTS YOU POST) IN OUR SERVICES, INCLUDING DISPLAYING
IN ADS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL CONTEXTS. WE WILL RESPECT THE CHOICES YOU
MAKE TO LIMIT SHARING OR VISIBILITY SETTINGS IN YOUR GOOGLE ACCOUNT.

WHEN YOU CONTACT GOOGLE, WE KEEP A RECORD OF YOUR COMMUNICATION TO
HELP SOLVE ANY ISSUES YOU MIGHT BE FACING. WE MAY USE YOUR EMAIL
ADDRESS TO INFORM YOU ABOUT OUR SERVICES, SUCH AS LETTING YOU KNOW
ABOUT UPCOMING CHANGES OR IMPROVEMENTS.

WE USE INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES, LIKE
PIXEL TAGS, TO IMPROVE YOUR USER EXPERIENCE AND THE OVERALL QUALITY OF
OUR SERVICES. ONE OF THE PRODUCTS WE USE TO DO THIS ON OUR OWN
SERVICES IS GOOGLE ANALYTICS. FOR EXAMPLE, BY SAVING YOUR LANGUAGE
PREFERENCES, WE’LL BE ABLE TO HAVE OUR SERVICES APPEAR IN THE LANGUAGE
YOU PREFER. WHEN SHOWING YOU TAILORED ADS, WE WILL NOT ASSOCIATE A
COOKIE OR ANONYMOUS IDENTIFIER WITH SENSITIVE CATEGORIES, SUCH AS
THOSE BASED ON RACE, RELIGION, SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR HEALTH.

OUR AUTOMATED SYSTEMS ANALYZE YOUR CONTENT (INCLUDING EMAILS) TO
PROVIDE YOU PERSONALLY RELEVANT PRODUCT FEATURES, SUCH AS CUSTOMIZED
SEARCH RESULTS, TAILORED ADVERTISING, AND SPAM AND MALWARE DETECTION.

WE MAY COMBINE PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM ONE SERVICE WITH INFORMATION,
INCLUDING PERSONAL INFORMATION, FROM OTHER GOOGLE SERVICES – FOR
EXAMPLE TO MAKE IT EASIER TO SHARE THINGS WITH PEOPLE YOU KNOW. WE
WILL NOT COMBINE DOUBLECLICK COOKIE INFORMATION WITH PERSONALLY
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION UNLESS WE HAVE YOUR OPT-IN CONSENT.

WE WILL ASK FOR YOUR CONSENT BEFORE USING INFORMATION FOR A PURPOSE
OTHER THAN THOSE THAT ARE SET OUT IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

GOOGLE PROCESSES PERSONAL INFORMATION ON OUR SERVERS IN MANY COUNTRIES
AROUND THE WORLD. WE MAY PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ON A SERVER
LOCATED OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU LIVE.

TRANSPARENCY AND CHOICE

PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT PRIVACY CONCERNS. OUR GOAL IS TO BE CLEAR ABOUT
WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT, SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE MEANINGFUL CHOICES
ABOUT HOW IT IS USED. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN:

REVIEW AND CONTROL CERTAIN TYPES OF INFORMATION TIED TO YOUR GOOGLE
ACCOUNT BY USING GOOGLE DASHBOARD. VIEW AND EDIT YOUR PREFERENCES
ABOUT THE ADS SHOWN TO YOU ON GOOGLE AND ACROSS THE WEB, SUCH AS WHICH
CATEGORIES MIGHT INTEREST YOU, USING ADS SETTINGS. YOU CAN ALSO OPT
OUT OF CERTAIN GOOGLE ADVERTISING SERVICES HERE. USE OUR EDITOR TO SEE
AND ADJUST HOW YOUR GOOGLE PROFILE APPEARS TO PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS.
CONTROL WHO YOU SHARE INFORMATION WITH. TAKE INFORMATION OUT OF MANY
OF OUR SERVICES. CHOOSE WHETHER YOUR PROFILE NAME AND PROFILE PHOTO
APPEAR IN SHARED ENDORSEMENTS THAT APPEAR IN ADS. YOU MAY ALSO SET
YOUR BROWSER TO BLOCK ALL COOKIES, INCLUDING COOKIES ASSOCIATED WITH
OUR SERVICES, OR TO INDICATE WHEN A COOKIE IS BEING SET BY US.
HOWEVER, IT’S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT MANY OF OUR SERVICES MAY NOT
FUNCTION PROPERLY IF YOUR COOKIES ARE DISABLED. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY
NOT REMEMBER YOUR LANGUAGE PREFERENCES.

INFORMATION YOU SHARE

MANY OF OUR SERVICES LET YOU SHARE INFORMATION WITH OTHERS. REMEMBER
THAT WHEN YOU SHARE INFORMATION PUBLICLY, IT MAY BE INDEXABLE BY
SEARCH ENGINES, INCLUDING GOOGLE. OUR SERVICES PROVIDE YOU WITH
DIFFERENT OPTIONS ON SHARING AND REMOVING YOUR CONTENT.

ACCESSING AND UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

WHENEVER YOU USE OUR SERVICES, WE AIM TO PROVIDE YOU WITH ACCESS TO
YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. IF THAT INFORMATION IS WRONG, WE STRIVE TO
GIVE YOU WAYS TO UPDATE IT QUICKLY OR TO DELETE IT – UNLESS WE HAVE TO
KEEP THAT INFORMATION FOR LEGITIMATE BUSINESS OR LEGAL PURPOSES. WHEN
UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION, WE MAY ASK YOU TO VERIFY YOUR
IDENTITY BEFORE WE CAN ACT ON YOUR REQUEST.

WE MAY REJECT REQUESTS THAT ARE UNREASONABLY REPETITIVE, REQUIRE
DISPROPORTIONATE TECHNICAL EFFORT (FOR EXAMPLE, DEVELOPING A NEW
SYSTEM OR FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING AN EXISTING PRACTICE), RISK THE
PRIVACY OF OTHERS, OR WOULD BE EXTREMELY IMPRACTICAL (FOR INSTANCE,
REQUESTS CONCERNING INFORMATION RESIDING ON BACKUP SYSTEMS).

WHERE WE CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION ACCESS AND CORRECTION, WE WILL DO SO
FOR FREE, EXCEPT WHERE IT WOULD REQUIRE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFORT. WE
AIM TO MAINTAIN OUR SERVICES IN A MANNER THAT PROTECTS INFORMATION
FROM ACCIDENTAL OR MALICIOUS DESTRUCTION. BECAUSE OF THIS, AFTER YOU
DELETE INFORMATION FROM OUR SERVICES, WE MAY NOT IMMEDIATELY DELETE
RESIDUAL COPIES FROM OUR ACTIVE SERVERS AND MAY NOT REMOVE INFORMATION

BUSINESSES OR PERSONS TO PROCESS IT FOR US, BASED ON OUR INSTRUCTIONS
AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY AND ANY OTHER APPROPRIATE
CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY MEASURES.

FOR LEGAL REASONS

WE WILL SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH COMPANIES, ORGANIZATIONS OR
INDIVIDUALS OUTSIDE OF GOOGLE IF WE HAVE A GOOD-FAITH BELIEF THAT
ACCESS, USE, PRESERVATION OR DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION IS
REASONABLY NECESSARY TO:

MEET ANY APPLICABLE LAW, REGULATION, LEGAL PROCESS OR ENFORCEABLE
GOVERNMENTAL REQUEST. ENFORCE APPLICABLE TERMS OF SERVICE, INCLUDING
INVESTIGATION OF POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS. DETECT, PREVENT, OR OTHERWISE
ADDRESS FRAUD, SECURITY OR TECHNICAL ISSUES. PROTECT AGAINST HARM TO
THE RIGHTS, PROPERTY OR SAFETY OF GOOGLE, OUR USERS OR THE PUBLIC AS
REQUIRED OR PERMITTED BY LAW. WE MAY SHARE AGGREGATED, NON-PERSONALLY
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION PUBLICLY AND WITH OUR PARTNERS – LIKE
PUBLISHERS, ADVERTISERS OR CONNECTED SITES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY SHARE
INFORMATION PUBLICLY TO SHOW TRENDS ABOUT THE GENERAL USE OF OUR
SERVICES.

IF GOOGLE IS INVOLVED IN A MERGER, ACQUISITION OR ASSET SALE, WE WILL
CONTINUE TO ENSURE THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION AND
GIVE AFFECTED USERS NOTICE BEFORE PERSONAL INFORMATION IS TRANSFERRED
OR BECOMES SUBJECT TO A DIFFERENT PRIVACY POLICY.

INFORMATION SECURITY

WE WORK HARD TO PROTECT GOOGLE AND OUR USERS FROM UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS
TO OR UNAUTHORIZED ALTERATION, DISCLOSURE OR DESTRUCTION OF
INFORMATION WE HOLD. IN PARTICULAR:

WE ENCRYPT MANY OF OUR SERVICES USING SSL. WE OFFER YOU TWO STEP
VERIFICATION WHEN YOU ACCESS YOUR GOOGLE ACCOUNT, AND A SAFE BROWSING
FEATURE IN GOOGLE CHROME. WE REVIEW OUR INFORMATION COLLECTION,
STORAGE AND PROCESSING PRACTICES, INCLUDING PHYSICAL SECURITY
MEASURES, TO GUARD AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO SYSTEMS. WE RESTRICT
ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION TO GOOGLE EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS AND
AGENTS WHO NEED TO KNOW THAT INFORMATION IN ORDER TO PROCESS IT FOR
US, AND WHO ARE SUBJECT TO STRICT CONTRACTUAL CONFIDENTIALITY
OBLIGATIONS AND MAY BE DISCIPLINED OR TERMINATED IF THEY FAIL TO MEET
THESE OBLIGATIONS. WHEN THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES

OUR PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES TO ALL OF THE SERVICES OFFERED BY GOOGLE
INC. AND ITS AFFILIATES, INCLUDING YOUTUBE, AND SERVICES OFFERED ON
OTHER SITES (SUCH AS OUR ADVERTISING SERVICES), BUT EXCLUDES SERVICES
THAT HAVE SEPARATE PRIVACY POLICIES THAT DO NOT INCORPORATE THIS
PRIVACY POLICY.

OUR PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT APPLY TO SERVICES OFFERED BY OTHER
COMPANIES OR INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING PRODUCTS OR SITES THAT MAY BE
DISPLAYED TO YOU IN SEARCH RESULTS, SITES THAT MAY INCLUDE GOOGLE
SERVICES, OR OTHER SITES LINKED FROM OUR SERVICES. OUR PRIVACY POLICY
DOES NOT COVER THE INFORMATION PRACTICES OF OTHER COMPANIES AND
ORGANIZATIONS WHO ADVERTISE OUR SERVICES, AND WHO MAY USE COOKIES,
PIXEL TAGS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES TO SERVE AND OFFER RELEVANT ADS.

COMPLIANCE AND COOPERATION WITH REGULATORY AUTHORITIES

WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR COMPLIANCE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY. WE ALSO
ADHERE TO SEVERAL SELF REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS. WHEN WE RECEIVE FORMAL
WRITTEN COMPLAINTS, WE WILL CONTACT THE PERSON WHO MADE THE COMPLAINT
TO FOLLOW UP. WE WORK WITH THE APPROPRIATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES,

UNLESS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY A MANDATORY LAW OF A MEMBER STATE OF THE
EUROPEAN UNION OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION, THESE AGREEMENTS ARE SUBJECT
TO THE LAW OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES, WITHOUT REGARD
TO CHOICE OR CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES. FURTHER, YOU AND SPOTIFY
AGREE TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS IN
SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA OR NEW YORK, NEW YORK TO RESOLVE ANY
DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY THAT ARISES IN CONNECTION WITH THESE
AGREEMENTS.

IF YOU ARE A UNITED STATES USER, THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION
PROVISIONS ALSO APPLY TO YOU:

YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SPOTIFY SERVICE OR YOUR USE
THEREOF, INCLUDING OUR AGREEMENTS, SHALL BE DETERMINED BY MANDATORY
BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU AGREE THAT THE U.S. FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT
GOVERNS THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS PROVISION, AND THAT
YOU AND SPOTIFY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE
RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR MULTI- PARTY ACTION. THIS
ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THESE AGREEMENTS
AND THE TERMINATION OF YOUR SPOTIFY ACCOUNT. THE ARBITRATION WILL BE

ADMINISTERED BY THE AAA. YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT THESE AGREEMENTS
INVOLVE INTERSTATE COMMERCE AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION
ACT. YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT (A) ANY CLAIMS SEEKING TO ENFORCE,

MANDATORY ARBITRATION. INSTEAD, YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT THESE
CLAIMS (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CLAIMS FOR INJUNCTIVE OR
EQUITABLE RELIEF) SHALL BE EXCLUSIVELY DECIDED BY COURTS OF COMPETENT
JURISDICTION IN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA OR NEW YORK, NEW
YORK, AND THAT APPLICABLE CALIFORNIA AND/OR FEDERAL LAW SHALL GOVERN,
WITHOUT REGARD TO CHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES. YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT
EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL
CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS MEMBER OR IN ANY REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY
OR PROCEEDING. FURTHER, NO ARBITRATOR SHALL CONSOLIDATE ANY OTHER
PERSON’S CLAIMS WITH YOUR CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER
ANY FORM OF A MULTI-PARTY OR CLASS PROCEEDING. IF THIS SPECIFIC
PROVISION IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE IN ANY WAY, THEN THE ENTIRETY
OF THIS ARBITRATION SECTION SHALL BE NULL AND VOID. THE ARBITRATOR MAY
NOT AWARD DECLARATORY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. ANY ARBITRATION MUST BE
COMMENCED BY FILING A DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION WITH THE AAA WITHIN ONE
(1) YEAR AFTER THE DATE THE PARTY ASSERTING THE CLAIM FIRST KNOWS OR
REASONABLY SHOULD KNOW OF THE ACT, OMISSION OR DEFAULT GIVING RISE TO
THE CLAIM; AND THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT TO ANY REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIM NOT
ASSERTED WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD. IF APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS A ONE-
YEAR LIMITATIONS PERIOD FOR ASSERTING CLAIMS, ANY CLAIM MUST BE
ASSERTED WITHIN THE SHORTEST TIME PERIOD PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
YOUR ARBITRATION FEES AND YOUR SHARE OF ARBITRATOR COMPENSATION WILL
BE LIMITED TO THOSE FEES SET FORTH IN THE AAA'S CONSUMER RULES WITH
THE REMAINDER PAID BY SPOTIFY. ANY ARBITRATION COSTS OR FEES DEEMED
“EXCESSIVE” WILL BE PAID BY SPOTIFY.

OFFERED WITH OTHER COMPANIES THROUGH OUR MOBILE APPLICATION OR WEBSITE
(COLLECTIVELY, THE “SERVICES”), YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.
THESE TERMS AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, SO IF YOU DO NOT
AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.

IN THE EVENT YOU USE A SERVICE, FEATURE, OR FUNCTIONALITY THAT IS
OPERATED BY A THIRD PARTY AND MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR SERVICES
(INCLUDING SERVICES WE JOINTLY OFFER WITH THE THIRD PARTY), EACH
PARTY’S TERMS WILL GOVERN AS TO THE RESPECTIVE PARTY’S RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOU. IN THESE INSTANCES, WE WILL TAKE STEPS TO MAKE THE THIRD
PARTY’S TERMS AVAILABLE TO YOU BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO USE THE SERVICE,
FEATURE, OR FUNCTIONALITY.

SNAPCHAT DOES NOT TRANSMIT ANY FUNDS AND IS NOT A MONEY-SERVICES
BUSINESS. TO THE EXTENT SUCH FUNCTIONALITY IS MADE AVAILABLE IN THE
SERVICES, IT IS PROVIDED BY AN UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTY, AND LIKE ANY
OTHER THIRD-PARTY SERVICE, SUBJECT TO THEIR TERMS OF USE.

ARBITRATION NOTICE: EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN
THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND
SNAPCHAT WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND YOU
WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE
ARBITRATION.

HAVE FUN

ALTHOUGH THESE TERMS FORM A PROPER LEGAL CONTRACT—AND INEVITABLY READ
LIKE A PROPER LEGAL CONTRACT—THE BULK OF THEM ARE SIMPLY DESIGNED TO
ENSURE OUR USERS HAVE FUN. THESE TERMS LET US PROVIDE AND CONTINUE TO
IMPROVE OUR SERVICES, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ENSURING THAT A FEW MEAN
USERS DON’T RUIN THE FUN FOR EVERYONE ELSE. YOUR PART IN THAT IS
SIMPLE. JUST USE COMMON SENSE: KEEP SENDING AWESOME SNAPS TO YOUR
FRIENDS, AND PLEASE DON’T SEND SNAPS THAT THEY DON’T WANT TO RECEIVE.

OUR AUDIENCE

SNAPCHAT IS INTENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE AT LEAST 13 YEARS OLD. PERSONS
UNDER THE AGE OF 13 ARE PROHIBITED FROM CREATING SNAPCHAT ACCOUNTS.
FOR CERTAIN FEATURES OR FUNCTIONALITY OFFERED BY US OR OTHERS THROUGH
THE SERVICES, USERS MUST BE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD. THOSE SERVICES MAY
BE SUBJECT TO SEPARATE TERMS FROM US OR THIRD PARTIES THAT CONTAIN
THESE FURTHER AGE REQUIREMENTS. IF YOU ARE UNDER 18 AND USE THOSE
SERVICES, YOU MAY BE VIOLATING THE THIRD PARTY’S GOVERNING TERMS,
WHICH WE DEEM A VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS AS WELL. WE DO, HOWEVER,
OFFER A LIMITED-FUNCTIONALITY VERSION OF SNAPCHAT, CALLED “SNAPKIDZ,”
FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13. SNAPKIDZ INCLUDES THE FAMILIAR
INTERFACE FOR TAKING SNAPS, CAPTIONING, DRAWING, AND SAVING SNAPS
LOCALLY ON THE DEVICE, BUT DOES NOT SUPPORT SENDING OR RECEIVING SNAPS
OR ADDING FRIENDS AND, SINCE THE EXPERIENCE IS LOCAL TO THE USER’S
DEVICE, NO SNAPCHAT ACCOUNT IS CREATED.

YOU AFFIRM THAT YOU ARE EITHER AT LEAST 18 YEARS OF AGE, OR AN
EMANCIPATED MINOR, OR POSSESS LEGAL PARENTAL OR GUARDIAN CONSENT, AND
ARE FULLY ABLE AND COMPETENT TO ENTER INTO THE TERMS, CONDITIONS,
OBLIGATIONS, AFFIRMATIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH
IN THESE TERMS, AND TO ABIDE BY AND COMPLY WITH THESE TERMS. IN
ADDITION, YOU AFFIRM THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED OR
REMOVED FROM THE SERVICES AND DO NOT HAVE MORE THAN ONE SNAPCHAT
ACCOUNT.

PERSON OR ENTITY. WE MAY, WITHOUT NOTICE AND IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION,
TERMINATE YOUR RIGHT TO USE THE SERVICES, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, AND

THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (USA), COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE UNITED
STATES (U.S.), AMERICA, AND SOMETIMES THE STATES, IS A FEDERAL
REPUBLIC[17][18] CONSISTING OF 50 STATES AND A FEDERAL DISTRICT. THE
48 CONTIGUOUS STATES AND WASHINGTON, D.C., ARE IN CENTRAL NORTH
AMERICA BETWEEN CANADA AND MEXICO. THE STATE OF ALASKA IS LOCATED IN
THE NORTHWESTERN PART OF NORTH AMERICA AND THE STATE OF HAWAII IS AN
ARCHIPELAGO IN THE MID-PACIFIC. THE COUNTRY ALSO HAS FIVE POPULATED
AND NINE UNPOPULATED TERRITORIES IN THE PACIFIC AND THE CARIBBEAN. AT
3.80 MILLION SQUARE MILES (9.85 MILLION KM2)[4] AND WITH AROUND 318
MILLION PEOPLE, THE UNITED STATES IS THE WORLD'S FOURTH-LARGEST
COUNTRY BY TOTAL AREA AND THIRD-LARGEST BY POPULATION. IT IS ONE OF
THE WORLD'S MOST ETHNICALLY DIVERSE AND MULTICULTURAL NATIONS, THE
PRODUCT OF LARGE-SCALE IMMIGRATION FROM MANY COUNTRIES.[19] THE
GEOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE OF THE UNITED STATES ARE ALSO EXTREMELY DIVERSE,
AND THE COUNTRY IS HOME TO A WIDE VARIETY OF WILDLIFE.[20]

PALEO-INDIANS MIGRATED FROM EURASIA TO WHAT IS NOW THE U.S. MAINLAND
AROUND 15,000 YEARS AGO,[21] WITH EUROPEAN COLONIZATION BEGINNING IN
THE 16TH CENTURY. THE UNITED STATES EMERGED FROM 13 BRITISH COLONIES
LOCATED ALONG THE EAST COAST. DISPUTES BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN AND THE
COLONIES LED TO THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. ON JULY 4, 1776, AS THE
COLONIES WERE FIGHTING GREAT BRITAIN IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY
WAR, DELEGATES FROM THE 13 COLONIES UNANIMOUSLY ISSUED THE DECLARATION
OF INDEPENDENCE. THE WAR ENDED IN 1783 WITH THE RECOGNITION OF
INDEPENDENCE OF THE UNITED STATES FROM THE KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN,
AND WAS THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL WAR OF INDEPENDENCE AGAINST A EUROPEAN
COLONIAL EMPIRE.[22][23] THE CURRENT CONSTITUTION WAS ADOPTED ON
SEPTEMBER 17, 1787. THE FIRST TEN AMENDMENTS, COLLECTIVELY NAMED THE
BILL OF RIGHTS, WERE RATIFIED IN 1791 AND DESIGNED TO GUARANTEE MANY
FUNDAMENTAL CIVIL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS.

DRIVEN BY THE DOCTRINE OF MANIFEST DESTINY, THE UNITED STATES EMBARKED
ON A VIGOROUS EXPANSION ACROSS NORTH AMERICA THROUGHOUT THE 19TH
CENTURY.[24] THIS INVOLVED DISPLACING NATIVE TRIBES, ACQUIRING NEW
TERRITORIES, AND GRADUALLY ADMITTING NEW STATES.[24] DURING THE SECOND
HALF OF THE 19TH CENTURY, THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR ENDED LEGAL SLAVERY
IN THE COUNTRY.[25] BY THE END OF THAT CENTURY, THE UNITED STATES
EXTENDED INTO THE PACIFIC OCEAN,[26] AND THE ECONOMY DRIVEN IN PART BY
THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN TO SOAR.[27] THE SPANISH–AMERICAN WAR
AND WORLD WAR I CONFIRMED THE COUNTRY'S STATUS AS A GLOBAL MILITARY
POWER. THE UNITED STATES EMERGED FROM WORLD WAR II AS A GLOBAL
SUPERPOWER, THE FIRST COUNTRY TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THE ONLY
COUNTRY TO USE THEM IN WARFARE, AND AS A PERMANENT MEMBER OF THE
UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL. THE END OF THE COLD WAR AND THE
DISSOLUTION OF THE SOVIET UNION LEFT THE UNITED STATES AS THE SOLE
SUPERPOWER.[28]

THE UNITED STATES IS A DEVELOPED COUNTRY AND HAS THE WORLD'S LARGEST
NATIONAL ECONOMY,[6] BENEFITING FROM AN ABUNDANCE OF NATURAL RESOURCES
AND HIGH WORKER PRODUCTIVITY.[29] WHILE THE U.S. ECONOMY IS CONSIDERED
POST-INDUSTRIAL, THE COUNTRY CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF THE WORLD'S
LARGEST MANUFACTURERS.[30] ACCOUNTING FOR 37% OF GLOBAL MILITARY
SPENDING,[31] IT IS THE WORLD'S FOREMOST ECONOMIC AND MILITARY POWER,
A PROMINENT POLITICAL AND CULTURAL FORCE, AND A LEADER IN SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS.[32]

CARTOGRAPHER MARTIN WALDSEEMÜLLER PRODUCED A WORLD MAP ON WHICH HE
NAMED THE LANDS OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE "AMERICA" AFTER THE ITALIAN
EXPLORER AND CARTOGRAPHER AMERIGO VESPUCCI (LATIN: AMERICUS
VESPUCIUS).[33] THE FIRST DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE OF THE PHRASE "UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA" IS FROM A LETTER DATED JANUARY 2, 1776, WRITTEN BY
STEPHEN MOYLAN, ESQ., GEORGE WASHINGTON'S AIDE-DE-CAMP AND MUSTER-
MASTER GENERAL OF THE CONTINENTAL ARMY. ADDRESSED TO LT. COL. JOSEPH
REED, MOYLAN EXPRESSED HIS WISH TO CARRY THE "FULL AND AMPLE POWERS OF
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA" TO SPAIN TO ASSIST IN THE REVOLUTIONARY
WAR EFFORT.[34]

THE FIRST PUBLICLY PUBLISHED EVIDENCE OF THE PHRASE "UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA" WAS IN AN ANONYMOUSLY WRITTEN ESSAY IN THE VIRGINIA GAZETTE
NEWSPAPER IN WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA, ON APRIL 6, 1776.[35][36] IN JUNE
1776, THOMAS JEFFERSON INCLUDED THE PHRASE "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"
IN ALL CAPITALIZED LETTERS IN THE HEADLINE OF HIS "ORIGINAL ROUGH
DRAUGHT" OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.[37][38] IN THE FINAL
FOURTH OF JULY VERSION OF THE DECLARATION, THE PERTINENT SECTION OF
THE TITLE WAS CHANGED TO READ, "THE UNANIMOUS DECLARATION OF THE
THIRTEEN UNITED STATES OF AMERICA".[39] IN 1777 THE ARTICLES OF
CONFEDERATION ANNOUNCED, "THE STILE OF THIS CONFEDERACY SHALL BE 'THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA'".[40]

THE SHORT FORM "UNITED STATES" IS ALSO STANDARD. OTHER COMMON FORMS
INCLUDE THE "U.S.", THE "USA", AND "AMERICA". COLLOQUIAL NAMES INCLUDE
THE "U.S. OF A." AND, INTERNATIONALLY, THE "STATES". "COLUMBIA", A
NAME POPULAR IN POETRY AND SONGS OF THE LATE 1700S, DERIVES ITS ORIGIN
FROM CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS; IT APPEARS IN THE NAME "DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA".[41] IN NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGES, THE NAME IS FREQUENTLY THE
TRANSLATION OF EITHER THE "UNITED STATES" OR "UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA", AND COLLOQUIALLY AS "AMERICA". IN ADDITION, AN ABBREVIATION
(E.G. USA) IS SOMETIMES USED.[42]

THE PHRASE "UNITED STATES" WAS ORIGINALLY TREATED AS PLURAL, A
DESCRIPTION OF A COLLECTION OF INDEPENDENT STATES—E.G., "THE UNITED
STATES ARE"—INCLUDING IN THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES
CONSTITUTION, RATIFIED IN 1865. IT BECAME COMMON TO TREAT IT AS
SINGULAR, A SINGLE UNIT—E.G., "THE UNITED STATES IS"—AFTER THE END OF
THE CIVIL WAR. THE SINGULAR FORM IS NOW STANDARD; THE PLURAL FORM IS
RETAINED IN THE IDIOM "THESE UNITED STATES".[43] THE DIFFERENCE HAS
BEEN DESCRIBED AS MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN ONE OF USAGE, BUT REFLECTING
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A COLLECTION OF STATES AND A UNIT.[44]

THE STANDARD WAY TO REFER TO A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES IS AS AN
"AMERICAN". "UNITED STATES", "AMERICAN" AND "U.S." ARE USED TO REFER
TO THE COUNTRY ADJECTIVALLY ("AMERICAN VALUES", "U.S. FORCES").
"AMERICAN" IS RARELY USED IN ENGLISH TO REFER TO SUBJECTS NOT
CONNECTED WITH THE UNITED STATES.[45]

HISTORY MAIN ARTICLES: HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES AND TIMELINE OF
UNITED STATES HISTORY

NATIVE AMERICANS MEETING WITH EUROPEANS, 1764 NATIVE AMERICAN AND
EUROPEAN CONTACT FURTHER INFORMATION: PRE-COLUMBIAN ERA AND COLONIAL
HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES THE FIRST NORTH AMERICAN SETTLERS
MIGRATED FROM SIBERIA BY WAY OF THE BERING LAND BRIDGE APPROXIMATELY
15,000 OR MORE YEARS AGO.[21][46][47] SOME, SUCH AS THE PRE-COLUMBIAN
MISSISSIPPIAN CULTURE, DEVELOPED ADVANCED AGRICULTURE, GRAND
ARCHITECTURE, AND STATE-LEVEL SOCIETIES. AFTER EUROPEAN EXPLORERS AND
TRADERS MADE THE FIRST CONTACTS, THE NATIVE POPULATION DECLINED FOR
VARIOUS REASONS, INCLUDING DISEASES SUCH AS SMALLPOX AND
MEASLES,[48][49] INTERMARRIAGE,[50] AND VIOLENCE.[51][52][53]

IN THE EARLY DAYS OF COLONIZATION MANY SETTLERS WERE SUBJECT TO FOOD
SHORTAGES, DISEASE AND ATTACKS FROM NATIVE AMERICANS. NATIVE AMERICANS
WERE ALSO OFTEN AT WAR WITH NEIGHBORING TRIBES AND ALLIED WITH
EUROPEANS IN THEIR COLONIAL WARS.[54] AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, MANY
NATIVES AND SETTLERS CAME TO DEPEND ON EACH OTHER. SETTLERS TRADED FOR
FOOD AND ANIMAL PELTS, NATIVES FOR GUNS, AMMUNITION AND OTHER EUROPEAN
WARES.[55] NATIVES TAUGHT MANY SETTLERS WHERE, WHEN AND HOW TO
CULTIVATE CORN, BEANS AND SQUASH. EUROPEAN MISSIONARIES AND OTHERS
FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO "CIVILIZE" THE INDIANS AND URGED THEM TO
CONCENTRATE ON FARMING AND RANCHING RATHER THAN DEPENDING ON HUNTING
AND GATHERING.[56][57]

SETTLEMENTS FURTHER INFORMATION: EUROPEAN COLONIZATION OF THE AMERICAS
AND THIRTEEN COLONIES

SIGNING OF THE MAYFLOWER COMPACT, 1620 AFTER COLUMBUS' FIRST VOYAGE TO
THE NEW WORLD IN 1492, OTHER EXPLORERS FOLLOWED WITH SETTLEMENT INTO
THE FLORIDAS AND THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST.[58][59] THERE WERE ALSO SOME
FRENCH ATTEMPTS TO COLONIZE THE EAST COAST, AND LATER MORE SUCCESSFUL
SETTLEMENTS ALONG THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER. SUCCESSFUL ENGLISH SETTLEMENT
ON THE EASTERN COAST OF NORTH AMERICA BEGAN WITH THE VIRGINIA COLONY
IN 1607 AT JAMESTOWN AND THE PILGRIMS' PLYMOUTH COLONY IN 1620. EARLY
EXPERIMENTS IN COMMUNAL LIVING FAILED UNTIL THE INTRODUCTION OF
PRIVATE FARM HOLDINGS.[60] MANY SETTLERS WERE DISSENTING CHRISTIAN
GROUPS WHO CAME SEEKING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. THE CONTINENT'S FIRST
ELECTED LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY, VIRGINIA'S HOUSE OF BURGESSES CREATED IN
1619, AND THE MAYFLOWER COMPACT, SIGNED BY THE PILGRIMS BEFORE
DISEMBARKING, ESTABLISHED PRECEDENTS FOR THE PATTERN OF REPRESENTATIVE
SELF-GOVERNMENT AND CONSTITUTIONALISM THAT WOULD DEVELOP THROUGHOUT
THE AMERICAN COLONIES.[61][62]

MOST SETTLERS IN EVERY COLONY WERE SMALL FARMERS, BUT OTHER INDUSTRIES
DEVELOPED WITHIN A FEW DECADES AS VARIED AS THE SETTLEMENTS. CASH
CROPS INCLUDED TOBACCO, RICE AND WHEAT. EXTRACTION INDUSTRIES GREW UP
IN FURS, FISHING AND LUMBER. MANUFACTURERS PRODUCED RUM AND SHIPS, AND
BY THE LATE COLONIAL PERIOD AMERICANS WERE PRODUCING ONE-SEVENTH OF
THE WORLD'S IRON SUPPLY.[63] CITIES EVENTUALLY DOTTED THE COAST TO
SUPPORT LOCAL ECONOMIES AND SERVE AS TRADE HUBS. ENGLISH COLONISTS
WERE SUPPLEMENTED BY WAVES OF SCOTCH-IRISH AND OTHER GROUPS. AS
COASTAL LAND GREW MORE EXPENSIVE FREED INDENTURED SERVANTS PUSHED
FURTHER WEST.[64] SLAVE CULTIVATION OF CASH CROPS BEGAN WITH THE
SPANISH IN THE 1500S, AND WAS ADOPTED BY THE ENGLISH, BUT LIFE
EXPECTANCY WAS MUCH HIGHER IN NORTH AMERICA BECAUSE OF LESS DISEASE
AND BETTER FOOD AND TREATMENT, LEADING TO A RAPID INCREASE IN THE
NUMBERS OF SLAVES.[65][66][67] COLONIAL SOCIETY WAS LARGELY DIVIDED
OVER THE RELIGIOUS AND MORAL IMPLICATIONS OF SLAVERY AND COLONIES
PASSED ACTS FOR AND AGAINST THE PRACTICE.[68][69] BUT BY THE TURN OF
THE 18TH CENTURY, AFRICAN SLAVES WERE REPLACING INDENTURED SERVANTS
FOR CASH CROP LABOR, ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHERN REGIONS.[70]

WITH THE COLONIZATION OF GEORGIA IN 1732, THE 13 COLONIES THAT WOULD
BECOME THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WERE ESTABLISHED.[71] ALL HAD
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH ELECTIONS OPEN TO MOST FREE MEN, WITH A GROWING
DEVOTION TO THE ANCIENT RIGHTS OF ENGLISHMEN AND A SENSE OF SELF-
GOVERNMENT STIMULATING SUPPORT FOR REPUBLICANISM.[72] WITH EXTREMELY
HIGH BIRTH RATES, LOW DEATH RATES, AND STEADY SETTLEMENT, THE COLONIAL
POPULATION GREW RAPIDLY. RELATIVELY SMALL NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATIONS
WERE ECLIPSED.[73] THE CHRISTIAN REVIVALIST MOVEMENT OF THE 1730S AND
1740S KNOWN AS THE GREAT AWAKENING FUELED INTEREST IN BOTH RELIGION
AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.[74]

IN THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR, BRITISH FORCES SEIZED CANADA FROM THE
FRENCH, BUT THE FRANCOPHONE POPULATION REMAINED POLITICALLY ISOLATED
FROM THE SOUTHERN COLONIES. EXCLUDING THE NATIVE AMERICANS, WHO WERE
BEING CONQUERED AND DISPLACED, THOSE 13 COLONIES HAD A POPULATION OF
OVER 2.1 MILLION IN 1770, ABOUT ONE-THIRD THAT OF BRITAIN. DESPITE
CONTINUING NEW ARRIVALS, THE RATE OF NATURAL INCREASE WAS SUCH THAT BY
THE 1770S ONLY A SMALL MINORITY OF AMERICANS HAD BEEN BORN
OVERSEAS.[75] THE COLONIES' DISTANCE FROM BRITAIN HAD ALLOWED THE
DEVELOPMENT OF SELF-GOVERNMENT, BUT THEIR SUCCESS MOTIVATED MONARCHS
TO PERIODICALLY SEEK TO REASSERT ROYAL AUTHORITY.[76]

INDEPENDENCE AND EXPANSION

THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE: THE COMMITTEE OF FIVE PRESENTING
THEIR DRAFT TO THE SECOND CONTINENTAL CONGRESS IN 1776 FURTHER
INFORMATION: AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY WAR, UNITED STATES DECLARATION OF
INDEPENDENCE AND AMERICAN REVOLUTION THE AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY WAR
WAS THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL COLONIAL WAR OF INDEPENDENCE AGAINST A
EUROPEAN POWER. AMERICANS HAD DEVELOPED AN IDEOLOGY OF "REPUBLICANISM"
ASSERTING THAT GOVERNMENT RESTED ON THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AS
EXPRESSED IN THEIR LOCAL LEGISLATURES. THEY DEMANDED THEIR RIGHTS AS
ENGLISHMEN, "NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION". THE BRITISH INSISTED
ON ADMINISTERING THE EMPIRE THROUGH PARLIAMENT, AND THE CONFLICT
ESCALATED INTO WAR.[77] FOLLOWING THE PASSAGE OF THE LEE RESOLUTION,
ON JULY 2, 1776, WHICH WAS THE ACTUAL VOTE FOR INDEPENDENCE, THE
CONGRESS ADOPTED THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, ON JULY 4, WHICH
PROCLAIMED, IN A LONG PREAMBLE, THAT HUMANITY IS CREATED EQUAL IN
THEIR UNALIENABLE RIGHTS AND THAT THOSE RIGHTS WERE NOT BEING
PROTECTED BY GREAT BRITAIN, AND FINALLY DECLARED, IN THE WORDS OF THE
RESOLUTION, THAT THE THIRTEEN COLONIES WERE INDEPENDENT STATES AND HAD
NO ALLEGIANCE TO THE BRITISH CROWN IN THE UNITED STATES. JULY FOURTH
IS CELEBRATED ANNUALLY AS INDEPENDENCE DAY. IN 1777, THE ARTICLES OF
CONFEDERATION ESTABLISHED A WEAK GOVERNMENT THAT OPERATED UNTIL
1789.[78]

BRITAIN RECOGNIZED THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE UNITED STATES FOLLOWING
THEIR DEFEAT AT YORKTOWN.[79] IN THE PEACE TREATY OF 1783, AMERICAN
SOVEREIGNTY WAS RECOGNIZED FROM THE ATLANTIC COAST WEST TO THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER. NATIONALISTS LED THE PHILADELPHIA CONVENTION OF
1787 IN WRITING THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, RATIFIED IN STATE
CONVENTIONS IN 1788. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS REORGANIZED INTO THREE
BRANCHES, ON THE PRINCIPLE OF CREATING SALUTARY CHECKS AND BALANCES,
IN 1789. GEORGE WASHINGTON, WHO HAD LED THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY TO
VICTORY, WAS THE FIRST PRESIDENT ELECTED UNDER THE NEW CONSTITUTION.
THE BILL OF RIGHTS, FORBIDDING FEDERAL RESTRICTION OF PERSONAL
FREEDOMS AND GUARANTEEING A RANGE OF LEGAL PROTECTIONS, WAS ADOPTED IN
1791.[80]

ALTHOUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CRIMINALIZED THE INTERNATIONAL SLAVE
TRADE IN 1808, AFTER 1820 CULTIVATION OF THE HIGHLY PROFITABLE COTTON
CROP EXPLODED IN THE DEEP SOUTH, AND ALONG WITH IT THE SLAVE
POPULATION.[81][82][83] THE SECOND GREAT AWAKENING, BEGINNING ABOUT
1800, CONVERTED MILLIONS TO EVANGELICAL PROTESTANTISM. IN THE NORTH IT
ENERGIZED MULTIPLE SOCIAL REFORM MOVEMENTS, INCLUDING
ABOLITIONISM;[84] IN THE SOUTH, METHODISTS AND BAPTISTS PROSELYTIZED
AMONG SLAVE POPULATIONS.[85]

AMERICANS' EAGERNESS TO EXPAND WESTWARD PROMPTED A LONG SERIES OF
AMERICAN INDIAN WARS.[86] THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE OF FRENCH-CLAIMED
TERRITORY IN 1803 ALMOST DOUBLED THE NATION'S SIZE.[87] THE WAR OF
1812, DECLARED AGAINST BRITAIN OVER VARIOUS GRIEVANCES AND FOUGHT TO A
DRAW, STRENGTHENED U.S. NATIONALISM.[88] A SERIES OF U.S. MILITARY
INCURSIONS INTO FLORIDA LED SPAIN TO CEDE IT AND OTHER GULF COAST
TERRITORY IN 1819.[89] EXPANSION WAS AIDED BY STEAM POWER, WHEN
STEAMBOATS BEGAN TRAVELING ALONG AMERICA'S LARGE WATER SYSTEMS, WHICH
WERE CONNECTED BY NEW CANALS, SUCH AS THE ERIE AND THE I&M; THEN, EVEN
FASTER RAILROADS BEGAN THEIR STRETCH ACROSS THE NATION'S LAND.[90]


U.S. TERRITORIAL ACQUISITIONS–PORTIONS OF EACH TERRITORY WERE GRANTED
STATEHOOD SINCE THE 18TH CENTURY. FROM 1820 TO 1850, JACKSONIAN
DEMOCRACY BEGAN A SET OF REFORMS WHICH INCLUDED WIDER MALE SUFFRAGE;
IT LED TO THE RISE OF THE SECOND PARTY SYSTEM OF DEMOCRATS AND WHIGS
AS THE DOMINANT PARTIES FROM 1828 TO 1854. THE TRAIL OF TEARS IN THE
1830S EXEMPLIFIED THE INDIAN REMOVAL POLICY THAT MOVED INDIANS INTO
THE WEST TO THEIR OWN RESERVATIONS. THE U.S. ANNEXED THE REPUBLIC OF
TEXAS IN 1845 DURING A PERIOD OF EXPANSIONIST MANIFEST DESTINY.[91]
THE 1846 OREGON TREATY WITH BRITAIN LED TO U.S. CONTROL OF THE
PRESENT-DAY AMERICAN NORTHWEST.[92] VICTORY IN THE MEXICAN–AMERICAN
WAR RESULTED IN THE 1848 MEXICAN CESSION OF CALIFORNIA AND MUCH OF THE
PRESENT-DAY AMERICAN SOUTHWEST.[93]

THE CALIFORNIA GOLD RUSH OF 1848–49 SPURRED WESTERN MIGRATION AND THE
CREATION OF ADDITIONAL WESTERN STATES.[94] AFTER THE AMERICAN CIVIL
WAR, NEW TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAYS MADE RELOCATION EASIER FOR
SETTLERS, EXPANDED INTERNAL TRADE AND INCREASED CONFLICTS WITH NATIVE
AMERICANS.[95] OVER A HALF-CENTURY, THE LOSS OF THE BUFFALO WAS AN
EXISTENTIAL BLOW TO MANY PLAINS INDIANS CULTURES.[96] IN 1869, A NEW
PEACE POLICY SOUGHT TO PROTECT NATIVE-AMERICANS FROM ABUSES, AVOID
FURTHER WARFARE, AND SECURE THEIR EVENTUAL U.S. CITIZENSHIP.[97]

CIVIL WAR AND RECONSTRUCTION ERA FURTHER INFORMATION: AMERICAN CIVIL
WAR AND RECONSTRUCTION ERA

BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA DURING THE CIVIL WAR BY THURE DE
THULSTRUP FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE UNITED STATES, INHERENT DIVISIONS
OVER SLAVERY BETWEEN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH IN AMERICAN SOCIETY
ULTIMATELY LED TO THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR.[98] INITIALLY, STATES
ENTERING THE UNION ALTERNATED BETWEEN SLAVE AND FREE STATES, KEEPING A
SECTIONAL BALANCE IN THE SENATE, WHILE FREE STATES OUTSTRIPPED SLAVE
STATES IN POPULATION AND IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. BUT WITH
ADDITIONAL WESTERN TERRITORY AND MORE FREE-SOIL STATES, TENSIONS
BETWEEN SLAVE AND FREE STATES MOUNTED WITH ARGUMENTS OVER FEDERALISM
AND DISPOSITION OF THE TERRITORIES, WHETHER AND HOW TO EXPAND OR
RESTRICT SLAVERY.[99]

WITH THE 1860 ELECTION OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN, THE FIRST PRESIDENT FROM
THE LARGELY ANTI-SLAVERY REPUBLICAN PARTY, CONVENTIONS IN THIRTEEN
STATES ULTIMATELY DECLARED SECESSION AND FORMED THE CONFEDERATE STATES
OF AMERICA, WHILE THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAINTAINED THAT
SECESSION WAS ILLEGAL.[99] THE ENSUING WAR WAS AT FIRST FOR UNION,
THEN AFTER 1863 AS CASUALTIES MOUNTED AND LINCOLN DELIVERED HIS
EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION, A SECOND WAR AIM BECAME ABOLITION OF
SLAVERY. THE WAR REMAINS THE DEADLIEST MILITARY CONFLICT IN AMERICAN
HISTORY, RESULTING IN THE DEATHS OF APPROXIMATELY 618,000 SOLDIERS AS
WELL AS MANY CIVILIANS.[100]

FOLLOWING THE UNION VICTORY IN 1865, THREE AMENDMENTS TO THE U.S.
CONSTITUTION BROUGHT ABOUT THE PROHIBITION OF SLAVERY, GAVE U.S.
CITIZENSHIP TO THE NEARLY FOUR MILLION AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO HAD BEEN
SLAVES,[101] AND PROMISED THEM VOTING RIGHTS. THE WAR AND ITS
RESOLUTION LED TO A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN FEDERAL POWER[102] AIMED
AT REINTEGRATING AND REBUILDING THE SOUTHERN STATES WHILE ENSURING THE
RIGHTS OF THE NEWLY FREED SLAVES.[103] BUT FOLLOWING THE
RECONSTRUCTION ERA, THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH JIM CROW LAWS SOON
EFFECTIVELY DISENFRANCHISED MOST BLACKS AND SOME POOR WHITES. OVER THE
SUBSEQUENT DECADES, IN BOTH THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH BLACKS AND SOME
WHITES FACED SYSTEMIC DISCRIMINATION, INCLUDING RACIAL SEGREGATION AND
OCCASIONAL VIGILANTE VIOLENCE, SPARKING NATIONAL MOVEMENTS AGAINST
THESE ABUSES.[103]

INDUSTRIALIZATION FURTHER INFORMATION: LABOR HISTORY OF THE UNITED
STATES

ELLIS ISLAND, IN NEW YORK CITY, WAS A MAJOR GATEWAY FOR THE INFLUX OF
IMMIGRATION FROM EUROPE IN THE NORTH, URBANIZATION AND AN
UNPRECEDENTED INFLUX OF IMMIGRANTS FROM SOUTHERN AND EASTERN EUROPE
SUPPLIED A SURPLUS OF LABOR FOR THE COUNTRY'S INDUSTRIALIZATION AND
TRANSFORMED ITS CULTURE.[104] NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING
TELEGRAPH AND TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROADS SPURRED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND
GREATER SETTLEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE AMERICAN OLD WEST. THE LATER
INVENTION OF ELECTRIC LIGHT AND THE TELEPHONE WOULD ALSO IMPACT
COMMUNICATION AND URBAN LIFE.[105] THE END OF THE INDIAN WARS FURTHER
EXPANDED ACREAGE UNDER MECHANICAL CULTIVATION, INCREASING SURPLUSES
FOR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.[106] MAINLAND EXPANSION WAS COMPLETED BY
THE PURCHASE OF ALASKA FROM RUSSIA IN 1867.[107] IN 1898 THE U.S.
ENTERED THE WORLD STAGE WITH IMPORTANT SUGAR PRODUCTION AND STRATEGIC
FACILITIES ACQUIRED IN HAWAII.[108] PUERTO RICO, GUAM, AND THE
PHILIPPINES WERE CEDED BY SPAIN IN THE SAME YEAR, FOLLOWING THE
SPANISH–AMERICAN WAR.[109]

RAPID ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AT THE END OF THE 19TH CENTURY PRODUCED
MANY PROMINENT INDUSTRIALISTS, AND THE U.S. ECONOMY BECAME THE WORLD'S
LARGEST.[110] DRAMATIC CHANGES WERE ACCOMPANIED BY SOCIAL UNREST AND
THE RISE OF POPULIST, SOCIALIST, AND ANARCHIST MOVEMENTS.[111] THIS
PERIOD EVENTUALLY ENDED WITH THE ADVENT OF THE PROGRESSIVE ERA, WHICH
SAW SIGNIFICANT REFORMS IN MANY SOCIETAL AREAS, INCLUDING WOMEN'S
SUFFRAGE, ALCOHOL PROHIBITION, REGULATION OF CONSUMER GOODS, GREATER
ANTITRUST MEASURES TO ENSURE COMPETITION AND ATTENTION TO WORKER
CONDITIONS.

WORLD WAR I, GREAT DEPRESSION, AND WORLD WAR II FURTHER INFORMATION:
WORLD WAR I, GREAT DEPRESSION AND WORLD WAR II

U.S. TROOPS APPROACHING OMAHA BEACH DURING WORLD WAR II THE UNITED
STATES REMAINED NEUTRAL AT THE OUTBREAK OF WORLD WAR I IN 1914, THOUGH
BY 1917, IT JOINED THE ALLIES, HELPING TO TURN THE TIDE AGAINST THE
CENTRAL POWERS. IN 1919, PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON TOOK A LEADING
DIPLOMATIC ROLE AT THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE AND ADVOCATED STRONGLY
FOR THE U.S. TO JOIN THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS. HOWEVER, THE SENATE
REFUSED TO APPROVE THIS, AND DID NOT RATIFY THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES
THAT ESTABLISHED THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.[112]

IN 1920, THE WOMEN'S RIGHTS MOVEMENT WON PASSAGE OF A CONSTITUTIONAL
AMENDMENT GRANTING WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE.[113] THE 1920S AND 1930S SAW THE
RISE OF RADIO FOR MASS COMMUNICATION AND THE INVENTION OF EARLY
TELEVISION.[114] THE PROSPERITY OF THE ROARING TWENTIES ENDED WITH THE
WALL STREET CRASH OF 1929 AND THE ONSET OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION. AFTER
HIS ELECTION AS PRESIDENT IN 1932, FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT RESPONDED
WITH THE NEW DEAL, WHICH INCLUDED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SOCIAL
SECURITY SYSTEM.[115] THE GREAT MIGRATION OF MILLIONS OF AFRICAN
AMERICANS OUT OF THE AMERICAN SOUTH BEGAN AROUND WWI AND EXTENDED
THROUGH THE 1960S;[116] WHEREAS THE DUST BOWL OF THE MID-1930S
IMPOVERISHED MANY FARMING COMMUNITIES AND SPURRED A NEW WAVE OF
WESTERN MIGRATION.[117]

THE UNITED STATES WAS AT FIRST EFFECTIVELY NEUTRAL DURING WORLD WAR
II'S EARLY STAGES BUT BEGAN SUPPLYING MATERIAL TO THE ALLIES IN MARCH
1941 THROUGH THE LEND-LEASE PROGRAM. ON DECEMBER 7, 1941, THE EMPIRE
OF JAPAN LAUNCHED A SURPRISE ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR, PROMPTING THE
UNITED STATES TO JOIN THE ALLIES AGAINST THE AXIS POWERS.[118] THOUGH
THE NATION LOST MORE THAN 400,000 SOLDIERS,[119] IT EMERGED RELATIVELY
UNDAMAGED FROM THE WAR WITH EVEN GREATER ECONOMIC AND MILITARY
INFLUENCE.[120] ALLIED CONFERENCES AT BRETTON WOODS AND YALTA OUTLINED
A NEW SYSTEM OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT PLACED THE UNITED
STATES AND SOVIET UNION AT THE CENTER OF WORLD AFFAIRS. AS AN ALLIED
VICTORY WAS WON IN EUROPE, A 1945 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE HELD IN SAN
FRANCISCO PRODUCED THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER, WHICH BECAME ACTIVE
AFTER THE WAR.[121] THE UNITED STATES DEVELOPED THE FIRST NUCLEAR
WEAPONS AND USED THEM ON JAPAN; THE JAPANESE SURRENDERED ON SEPTEMBER
2, ENDING WORLD WAR II.[122]

COLD WAR AND CIVIL RIGHTS ERA MAIN ARTICLES: HISTORY OF THE UNITED
STATES (1945–64), HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES (1964–80) AND HISTORY
OF THE UNITED STATES (1980–91)

US PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN (LEFT) AND SOVIET GENERAL SECRETARY MIKHAIL
GORBACHEV, MEETING IN GENEVA IN 1985 AFTER WORLD WAR II THE UNITED
STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION JOCKEYED FOR POWER DURING WHAT IS KNOWN AS
THE COLD WAR, DRIVEN BY AN IDEOLOGICAL DIVIDE BETWEEN CAPITALISM AND
COMMUNISM. THEY DOMINATED THE MILITARY AFFAIRS OF EUROPE, WITH THE
U.S. AND ITS NATO ALLIES ON ONE SIDE AND THE USSR AND ITS WARSAW PACT
ALLIES ON THE OTHER. THE U.S. DEVELOPED A POLICY OF "CONTAINMENT"
TOWARD SOVIET BLOC EXPANSION. WHILE THEY ENGAGED IN PROXY WARS AND
DEVELOPED POWERFUL NUCLEAR ARSENALS, THE TWO COUNTRIES AVOIDED DIRECT
MILITARY CONFLICT. THE U.S. OFTEN OPPOSED THIRD WORLD LEFT-WING
MOVEMENTS THAT IT VIEWED AS SOVIET-SPONSORED. AMERICAN TROOPS FOUGHT
COMMUNIST CHINESE AND NORTH KOREAN FORCES IN THE KOREAN WAR OF
1950–53. THE SOVIET UNION'S 1957 LAUNCH OF THE FIRST ARTIFICIAL
SATELLITE AND ITS 1961 LAUNCH OF THE FIRST MANNED SPACEFLIGHT
INITIATED A "SPACE RACE" IN WHICH THE UNITED STATES BECAME THE FIRST
TO LAND A MAN ON THE MOON IN 1969.[123] A PROXY WAR WAS EXPANDED IN
SOUTHEAST ASIA WITH THE VIETNAM WAR.[FN 1]

AT HOME, THE U.S. EXPERIENCED SUSTAINED ECONOMIC EXPANSION AND A RAPID
GROWTH OF ITS POPULATION AND MIDDLE CLASS. CONSTRUCTION OF AN
INTERSTATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM TRANSFORMED THE NATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE OVER
THE FOLLOWING DECADES. MILLIONS MOVED FROM FARMS AND INNER CITIES TO
LARGE SUBURBAN HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS.[130][131] A GROWING CIVIL RIGHTS
MOVEMENT USED NONVIOLENCE TO CONFRONT SEGREGATION AND DISCRIMINATION,
WITH MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. BECOMING A PROMINENT LEADER AND
FIGUREHEAD. A COMBINATION OF COURT DECISIONS AND LEGISLATION,
CULMINATING IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964, SOUGHT TO END RACIAL
DISCRIMINATION.[132][133][134] MEANWHILE, A COUNTERCULTURE MOVEMENT
GREW WHICH WAS FUELED BY OPPOSITION TO THE VIETNAM WAR, BLACK
NATIONALISM, AND THE SEXUAL REVOLUTION. THE LAUNCH OF A "WAR ON
POVERTY" EXPANDED ENTITLEMENT AND WELFARE SPENDING.[135]

THE 1970S AND EARLY 1980S SAW THE ONSET OF STAGFLATION. AFTER HIS
ELECTION IN 1980, PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN RESPONDED TO ECONOMIC
STAGNATION WITH FREE-MARKET ORIENTED REFORMS. FOLLOWING THE COLLAPSE
OF DÉTENTE, HE ABANDONED "CONTAINMENT" AND INITIATED THE MORE
AGGRESSIVE "ROLLBACK" STRATEGY TOWARDS THE
USSR.[136][137][138][139][140] AFTER A SURGE IN FEMALE LABOR
PARTICIPATION OVER THE PREVIOUS DECADE, BY 1985 THE MAJORITY OF WOMEN
AGED 16 AND OVER WERE EMPLOYED.[141] THE LATE 1980S BROUGHT A "THAW"
IN RELATIONS WITH THE USSR, AND ITS COLLAPSE IN 1991 FINALLY ENDED THE
COLD WAR.[142][143][144][145]

CONTEMPORARY HISTORY

THE FORMER WORLD TRADE CENTER IN LOWER MANHATTAN ON 9/11

ONE WORLD TRADE CENTER, BUILT IN ITS PLACE MAIN ARTICLE: HISTORY OF
THE UNITED STATES (1991–PRESENT) AFTER THE COLD WAR, THE 1990S SAW THE
LONGEST ECONOMIC EXPANSION IN MODERN U.S. HISTORY, ENDING IN
2001.[146] ORIGINATING IN U.S. DEFENSE NETWORKS, THE INTERNET SPREAD
TO INTERNATIONAL ACADEMIC NETWORKS, AND THEN TO THE PUBLIC IN THE
1990S, GREATLY IMPACTING THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, SOCIETY, AND
CULTURE.[147] ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, AL-QAEDA TERRORISTS STRUCK THE
WORLD TRADE CENTER IN NEW YORK CITY AND THE PENTAGON NEAR WASHINGTON,
D.C., KILLING NEARLY 3,000 PEOPLE.[148] IN RESPONSE THE UNITED STATES
LAUNCHED THE WAR ON TERROR, WHICH INCLUDES THE ONGOING WAR IN
AFGHANISTAN AND THE 2003–11 IRAQ WAR.[149][150]

BEGINNING IN 1994, THE U.S. PARTICIPATES IN THE WORLD'S LARGEST TRADE
BLOC IN THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT (NAFTA), LINKING 450
MILLION PEOPLE PRODUCING $17 TRILLION WORTH OF GOODS AND SERVICES. THE
GOAL OF THE AGREEMENT AMONG THE U.S., CANADA AND MEXICO WAS MET TO
ELIMINATE TRADE AND INVESTMENT BARRIERS AMONG THEM BY JANUARY 1, 2008;
TRADE AMONG THE PARTNERS HAS SOARED SINCE THE AGREEMENT WENT INTO
FORCE.[151]

BARACK OBAMA, THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN,[152] AND MULTIRACIAL[153]
PRESIDENT, WAS ELECTED IN 2008 AMID THE GREAT RECESSION,[154] WHICH
BEGAN IN DECEMBER 2007 AND ENDED IN JUNE 2009.[155]

GEOGRAPHY, CLIMATE, AND ENVIRONMENT MAIN ARTICLES: GEOGRAPHY OF THE
UNITED STATES, CLIMATE OF THE UNITED STATES AND ENVIRONMENT OF THE
UNITED STATES

A COMPOSITE SATELLITE IMAGE OF THE CONTIGUOUS UNITED STATES AND
SURROUNDING AREAS THE LAND AREA OF THE CONTIGUOUS UNITED STATES IS
2,959,064 SQUARE MILES (7,663,941 KM2). ALASKA, SEPARATED FROM THE
CONTIGUOUS UNITED STATES BY CANADA, IS THE LARGEST STATE AT 663,268
SQUARE MILES (1,717,856 KM2). HAWAII, OCCUPYING AN ARCHIPELAGO IN THE
CENTRAL PACIFIC, SOUTHWEST OF NORTH AMERICA, IS 10,931 SQUARE MILES
(28,311 KM2) IN AREA.[156]

THE UNITED STATES IS THE WORLD'S THIRD OR FOURTH LARGEST NATION BY
TOTAL AREA (LAND AND WATER), RANKING BEHIND RUSSIA AND CANADA AND JUST
ABOVE OR BELOW CHINA. THE RANKING VARIES DEPENDING ON HOW TWO
TERRITORIES DISPUTED BY CHINA AND INDIA ARE COUNTED AND HOW THE TOTAL
SIZE OF THE UNITED STATES IS MEASURED: CALCULATIONS RANGE FROM
3,676,486 SQUARE MILES (9,522,055 KM2)[157] TO 3,717,813 SQUARE MILES
(9,629,091 KM2)[158] TO 3,794,101 SQUARE MILES (9,826,676 KM2).[159]
TO 3,805,927 SQUARE MILES (9,857,306 KM2).[4] MEASURED BY ONLY LAND
AREA, THE UNITED STATES IS THIRD IN SIZE BEHIND RUSSIA AND CHINA, JUST
AHEAD OF CANADA.[160]

THE COASTAL PLAIN OF THE ATLANTIC SEABOARD GIVES WAY FURTHER INLAND TO
DECIDUOUS FORESTS AND THE ROLLING HILLS OF THE PIEDMONT.[161] THE
APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS DIVIDE THE EASTERN SEABOARD FROM THE GREAT LAKES
AND THE GRASSLANDS OF THE MIDWEST.[162] THE MISSISSIPPI–MISSOURI
RIVER, THE WORLD'S FOURTH LONGEST RIVER SYSTEM, RUNS MAINLY
NORTH–SOUTH THROUGH THE HEART OF THE COUNTRY. THE FLAT, FERTILE
PRAIRIE OF THE GREAT PLAINS STRETCHES TO THE WEST, INTERRUPTED BY A
HIGHLAND REGION IN THE SOUTHEAST.[162]

THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS, AT THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE GREAT PLAINS, EXTEND
NORTH TO SOUTH ACROSS THE COUNTRY, REACHING ALTITUDES HIGHER THAN
14,000 FEET (4,300 M) IN COLORADO.[163] FARTHER WEST ARE THE ROCKY
GREAT BASIN AND DESERTS SUCH AS THE CHIHUAHUA AND MOJAVE.[164] THE
SIERRA NEVADA AND CASCADE MOUNTAIN RANGES RUN CLOSE TO THE PACIFIC
COAST, BOTH RANGES REACHING ALTITUDES HIGHER THAN 14,000 FEET (4,300
M). THE LOWEST AND HIGHEST POINTS IN THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES ARE
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,[165] AND ONLY ABOUT 84 MILES (135 KM)
APART.[166] AT 20,320 FEET (6,194 M), ALASKA'S MOUNT MCKINLEY IS THE
TALLEST PEAK IN THE COUNTRY AND IN NORTH AMERICA.[167] ACTIVE
VOLCANOES ARE COMMON THROUGHOUT ALASKA'S ALEXANDER AND ALEUTIAN
ISLANDS, AND HAWAII CONSISTS OF VOLCANIC ISLANDS. THE SUPERVOLCANO
UNDERLYING YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK IN THE ROCKIES IS THE CONTINENT'S
LARGEST VOLCANIC FEATURE.[168]

THE UNITED STATES, WITH ITS LARGE SIZE AND GEOGRAPHIC VARIETY,
INCLUDES MOST CLIMATE TYPES. TO THE EAST OF THE 100TH MERIDIAN, THE
CLIMATE RANGES FROM HUMID CONTINENTAL IN THE NORTH TO HUMID
SUBTROPICAL IN THE SOUTH.[169] THE SOUTHERN TIP OF FLORIDA IS
TROPICAL, AS IS HAWAII.[170] THE GREAT PLAINS WEST OF THE 100TH
MERIDIAN ARE SEMI-ARID. MUCH OF THE WESTERN MOUNTAINS HAVE AN ALPINE
CLIMATE. THE CLIMATE IS ARID IN THE GREAT BASIN, DESERT IN THE
SOUTHWEST, MEDITERRANEAN IN COASTAL CALIFORNIA, AND OCEANIC IN COASTAL
OREGON AND WASHINGTON AND SOUTHERN ALASKA. MOST OF ALASKA IS SUBARCTIC
OR POLAR. EXTREME WEATHER IS NOT UNCOMMON—THE STATES BORDERING THE
GULF OF MEXICO ARE PRONE TO HURRICANES, AND MOST OF THE WORLD'S
TORNADOES OCCUR WITHIN THE COUNTRY, MAINLY IN TORNADO ALLEY AREAS IN
THE MIDWEST.[171]

WILDLIFE MAIN ARTICLES: FAUNA OF THE UNITED STATES AND FLORA OF THE
UNITED STATES

THE BALD EAGLE HAS BEEN THE NATIONAL BIRD OF THE UNITED STATES SINCE
1782. THE U.S. ECOLOGY IS MEGADIVERSE: ABOUT 17,000 SPECIES OF
VASCULAR PLANTS OCCUR IN THE CONTIGUOUS UNITED STATES AND ALASKA, AND
OVER 1,800 SPECIES OF FLOWERING PLANTS ARE FOUND IN HAWAII, FEW OF
WHICH OCCUR ON THE MAINLAND.[172] THE UNITED STATES IS HOME TO 428
MAMMAL SPECIES, 784 BIRD SPECIES, 311 REPTILE SPECIES, AND 295
AMPHIBIAN SPECIES. [173] ABOUT 91,000 INSECT SPECIES HAVE BEEN
DESCRIBED.[174] THE BALD EAGLE IS BOTH THE NATIONAL BIRD AND NATIONAL
ANIMAL OF THE UNITED STATES, AND IS AN ENDURING SYMBOL OF THE COUNTRY
ITSELF.[175]

THERE ARE 58 NATIONAL PARKS AND HUNDREDS OF OTHER FEDERALLY MANAGED
PARKS, FORESTS, AND WILDERNESS AREAS.[176] ALTOGETHER, THE GOVERNMENT
OWNS ABOUT 28% OF THE COUNTRY'S LAND AREA.[177] MOST OF THIS IS
PROTECTED, THOUGH SOME IS LEASED FOR OIL AND GAS DRILLING, MINING,
LOGGING, OR CATTLE RANCHING; ABOUT .86% IS USED FOR MILITARY
PURPOSES.[178][179][180]

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES HAVE BEEN ON THE NATIONAL AGENDA SINCE 1970.
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROVERSIES INCLUDE DEBATES ON OIL AND NUCLEAR ENERGY,
DEALING WITH AIR AND WATER POLLUTION, THE ECONOMIC COSTS OF PROTECTING
WILDLIFE, LOGGING AND DEFORESTATION,[181][182] AND INTERNATIONAL
RESPONSES TO GLOBAL WARMING.[183][184] MANY FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES
ARE INVOLVED. THE MOST PROMINENT IS THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
AGENCY (EPA), CREATED BY PRESIDENTIAL ORDER IN 1970.[185] THE IDEA OF
WILDERNESS HAS SHAPED THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC LANDS SINCE 1964, WITH
THE WILDERNESS ACT.[186] THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT OF 1973 IS
INTENDED TO PROTECT THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES AND THEIR
HABITATS, WHICH ARE MONITORED BY THE UNITED STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE
SERVICE.

RACE)   82.9%

THE STATUE OF LIBERTY IN NEW YORK CITY IS A SYMBOL OF BOTH THE U.S.
AND THE IDEALS OF FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, AND OPPORTUNITY.[188] THE U.S.
CENSUS BUREAU ESTIMATES THE COUNTRY'S POPULATION NOW TO BE
320,213,000,[5] THE U.S. POPULATION ALMOST QUADRUPLED DURING THE 20TH
CENTURY, FROM ABOUT 76 MILLION IN 1900.[189] THE THIRD MOST POPULOUS
NATION IN THE WORLD, AFTER CHINA AND INDIA, THE UNITED STATES IS THE
ONLY MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED NATION IN WHICH LARGE POPULATION INCREASES
ARE PROJECTED.[190]

THE UNITED STATES HAS A VERY DIVERSE POPULATION; 37 ANCESTRY GROUPS
HAVE MORE THAN ONE MILLION MEMBERS.[191] GERMAN AMERICANS ARE THE
LARGEST ETHNIC GROUP (MORE THAN 50 MILLION) - FOLLOWED BY IRISH
AMERICANS (CIRCA 37 MILLION), MEXICAN AMERICANS (CIRCA 31 MILLION) AND
ENGLISH AMERICANS (CIRCA 28 MILLION).[192][193]

WHITE AMERICANS ARE THE LARGEST RACIAL GROUP; BLACK AMERICANS ARE THE
NATION'S LARGEST RACIAL MINORITY AND THIRD LARGEST ANCESTRY
GROUP.[191] ASIAN AMERICANS ARE THE COUNTRY'S SECOND LARGEST RACIAL
MINORITY; THE THREE LARGEST ASIAN AMERICAN ETHNIC GROUPS ARE CHINESE
AMERICANS, FILIPINO AMERICANS, AND INDIAN AMERICANS.[191]

THE UNITED STATES HAS A BIRTH RATE OF 13 PER 1,000, WHICH IS 35% BELOW
THE WORLD AVERAGE. NEVERTHELESS, ITS POPULATION GROWTH RATE IS
POSITIVE AT 0.9%, SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF MANY DEVELOPED
NATIONS.[194] IN FISCAL YEAR 2012, OVER ONE MILLION IMMIGRANTS (MOST
OF WHOM ENTERED THROUGH FAMILY REUNIFICATION) WERE GRANTED LEGAL
RESIDENCE.[195] MEXICO HAS BEEN THE LEADING SOURCE OF NEW RESIDENTS
SINCE THE 1965 IMMIGRATION ACT. CHINA, INDIA, AND THE PHILIPPINES HAVE
BEEN IN THE TOP FOUR SENDING COUNTRIES EVERY YEAR SINCE THE
1990S.[196] AS OF 2012, APPROXIMATELY 11.4 MILLION RESIDENTS ARE
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.[197]

ACCORDING TO A SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE WILLIAMS INSTITUTE, NINE
MILLION AMERICANS, OR ROUGHLY 3.4% OF THE ADULT POPULATION IDENTIFY
THEMSELVES AS HOMOSEXUAL, BISEXUAL, OR TRANSGENDER.[198][199] A 2012
GALLUP POLL ALSO CONCLUDED THAT 3.5% OF ADULT AMERICANS IDENTIFIED AS
LGBT. THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE CAME FROM THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA (10%),
WHILE THE LOWEST STATE WAS NORTH DAKOTA AT 1.7%.[200] IN A 2013
SURVEY, THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION FOUND THAT
96.6% OF AMERICANS IDENTIFY AS STRAIGHT, WHILE 1.6% IDENTIFY AS GAY OR
LESBIAN, AND 0.7% IDENTIFY AS BEING BISEXUAL.[201]

IN 2010, THE U.S. POPULATION INCLUDED AN ESTIMATED 5.2 MILLION PEOPLE
WITH SOME AMERICAN INDIAN OR ALASKA NATIVE ANCESTRY (2.9 MILLION
EXCLUSIVELY OF SUCH ANCESTRY) AND 1.2 MILLION WITH SOME NATIVE
HAWAIIAN OR PACIFIC ISLAND ANCESTRY (0.5 MILLION EXCLUSIVELY).[202]
THE CENSUS COUNTED MORE THAN 19 MILLION PEOPLE OF "SOME OTHER RACE"
WHO WERE "UNABLE TO IDENTIFY WITH ANY" OF ITS FIVE OFFICIAL RACE
CATEGORIES IN 2010.[202]

THE POPULATION GROWTH OF HISPANIC AND LATINO AMERICANS (THE TERMS ARE
OFFICIALLY INTERCHANGEABLE) IS A MAJOR DEMOGRAPHIC TREND. THE 50.5
MILLION AMERICANS OF HISPANIC DESCENT[202] ARE IDENTIFIED AS SHARING A
DISTINCT "ETHNICITY" BY THE CENSUS BUREAU; 64% OF HISPANIC AMERICANS
ARE OF MEXICAN DESCENT.[203] BETWEEN 2000 AND 2010, THE COUNTRY'S
HISPANIC POPULATION INCREASED 43% WHILE THE NON-HISPANIC POPULATION
ROSE JUST 4.9%.[204] MUCH OF THIS GROWTH IS FROM IMMIGRATION; IN 2007,
12.6% OF THE U.S. POPULATION WAS FOREIGN-BORN, WITH 54% OF THAT FIGURE
BORN IN LATIN AMERICA.[205]

FERTILITY IS ALSO A FACTOR; IN 2010 THE AVERAGE HISPANIC (OF ANY RACE)
WOMAN GAVE BIRTH TO 2.35 CHILDREN IN HER LIFETIME, COMPARED TO 1.97
FOR NON-HISPANIC BLACK WOMEN AND 1.79 FOR NON-HISPANIC WHITE WOMEN
(BOTH BELOW THE REPLACEMENT RATE OF 2.1).[206] MINORITIES (AS DEFINED
BY THE CENSUS BUREAU AS ALL THOSE BESIDE NON-HISPANIC, NON-MULTIRACIAL
WHITES) CONSTITUTED 36.3% OF THE POPULATION IN 2010,[207] AND OVER 50%
OF CHILDREN UNDER AGE ONE,[208] AND ARE PROJECTED TO CONSTITUTE THE
MAJORITY BY 2042.[209] THIS CONTRADICTS THE REPORT BY THE NATIONAL
VITAL STATISTICS REPORTS, BASED ON THE U.S. CENSUS DATA, WHICH
CONCLUDES THAT 54% (2,162,406 OUT OF 3,999,386 IN 2010) OF BIRTHS WERE
NON-HISPANIC WHITE.[206]

ABOUT 82% OF AMERICANS LIVE IN URBAN AREAS (INCLUDING SUBURBS);[159]
ABOUT HALF OF THOSE RESIDE IN CITIES WITH POPULATIONS OVER
50,000.[210] IN 2008, 273 INCORPORATED PLACES HAD POPULATIONS OVER
100,000, NINE CITIES HAD MORE THAN ONE MILLION RESIDENTS, AND FOUR
GLOBAL CITIES HAD OVER TWO MILLION (NEW YORK CITY, LOS ANGELES,
CHICAGO, AND HOUSTON).[211] THERE ARE 52 METROPOLITAN AREAS WITH
POPULATIONS GREATER THAN ONE MILLION.[212] OF THE 50 FASTEST-GROWING
METRO AREAS, 47 ARE IN THE WEST OR SOUTH.[213] THE METRO AREAS OF
DALLAS, HOUSTON, ATLANTA, AND PHOENIX ALL GREW BY MORE THAN A MILLION
PEOPLE BETWEEN 2000 AND 2008.[212]

NATURALIZATION REQUIREMENTS—STANDARDIZE ENGLISH. IN 2010, ABOUT 230
MILLION, OR 80% OF THE POPULATION AGED FIVE YEARS AND OLDER, SPOKE
ONLY ENGLISH AT HOME. SPANISH, SPOKEN BY 12% OF THE POPULATION AT
HOME, IS THE SECOND MOST COMMON LANGUAGE AND THE MOST WIDELY TAUGHT
SECOND LANGUAGE.[215][216] SOME AMERICANS ADVOCATE MAKING ENGLISH THE
COUNTRY'S OFFICIAL LANGUAGE, AS IT IS IN 28 STATES.[9]

BOTH HAWAIIAN AND ENGLISH ARE OFFICIAL LANGUAGES IN HAWAII, BY STATE
LAW.[217] WHILE NEITHER HAS AN OFFICIAL LANGUAGE, NEW MEXICO HAS LAWS
PROVIDING FOR THE USE OF BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH, AS LOUISIANA DOES
FOR ENGLISH AND FRENCH.[218] OTHER STATES, SUCH AS CALIFORNIA, MANDATE
THE PUBLICATION OF SPANISH VERSIONS OF CERTAIN GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS
INCLUDING COURT FORMS.[219] MANY JURISDICTIONS WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF
NON-ENGLISH SPEAKERS PRODUCE GOVERNMENT MATERIALS, ESPECIALLY VOTING
INFORMATION, IN THE MOST COMMONLY SPOKEN LANGUAGES IN THOSE
JURISDICTIONS.

SEVERAL INSULAR TERRITORIES GRANT OFFICIAL RECOGNITION TO THEIR NATIVE
LANGUAGES, ALONG WITH ENGLISH: SAMOAN[220] AND CHAMORRO[221] ARE
RECOGNIZED BY AMERICAN SAMOA AND GUAM, RESPECTIVELY; CAROLINIAN AND
CHAMORRO ARE RECOGNIZED BY THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS;[222] CHEROKEE
IS OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED BY THE CHEROKEE NATION WITHIN THE CHEROKEE

THE FIRST AMENDMENT OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES THE FREE
EXERCISE OF RELIGION AND FORBIDS CONGRESS FROM PASSING LAWS RESPECTING
ITS ESTABLISHMENT. CHRISTIANITY IS BY FAR THE MOST COMMON RELIGION
PRACTICED IN THE U.S., BUT OTHER RELIGIONS ARE FOLLOWED, TOO. IN A
2013 SURVEY, 56% OF AMERICANS SAID THAT RELIGION PLAYED A "VERY
IMPORTANT ROLE IN THEIR LIVES", A FAR HIGHER FIGURE THAN THAT OF ANY
OTHER WEALTHY NATION.[226] IN A 2009 GALLUP POLL 42% OF AMERICANS SAID
THAT THEY ATTENDED CHURCH WEEKLY OR ALMOST WEEKLY; THE FIGURES RANGED
FROM A LOW OF 23% IN VERMONT TO A HIGH OF 63% IN MISSISSIPPI.[227] AS
WITH OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES, THE U.S. IS BECOMING LESS RELIGIOUS.
IRRELIGION IS GROWING RAPIDLY AMONG AMERICANS UNDER 30.[228] POLLS
SHOW THAT OVERALL AMERICAN CONFIDENCE IN ORGANIZED RELIGION IS
DECLINING,[229] AND THAT YOUNGER AMERICANS IN PARTICULAR ARE BECOMING
INCREASINGLY IRRELIGIOUS.[230]

ACCORDING TO A 2014 SURVEY, 78.5% OF ADULTS IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS
CHRISTIAN,[231] PROTESTANT DENOMINATIONS ACCOUNTED FOR 51.3%, WHILE
ROMAN CATHOLICISM, AT 23.9%, WAS THE LARGEST INDIVIDUAL
DENOMINATION.[232] THE TOTAL REPORTING NON-CHRISTIAN RELIGIONS IN 2012
WAS 4.9%, UP FROM 4% IN 2007.[232] OTHER RELIGIONS INCLUDE JUDAISM
(1.7%), BUDDHISM (0.7%), ISLAM (0.6%), HINDUISM (0.4%), AND UNITARIAN
UNIVERSALISM (0.3%).[232] THE SURVEY ALSO REPORTED THAT 16.1% OF
AMERICANS DESCRIBED THEMSELVES AS AGNOSTIC, ATHEIST OR SIMPLY HAVING
NO RELIGION, UP FROM 8.2% IN 1990.[232][233][234] THERE ARE ALSO
BAHA'I, SIKH, JAIN, SHINTO, CONFUCIAN, TAOIST, DRUID, NATIVE AMERICAN,
WICCAN, HUMANIST AND DEIST COMMUNITIES.[235]

PROTESTANTISM IS THE LARGEST CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS GROUPING IN THE
UNITED STATES. BAPTISTS COLLECTIVELY FORM THE LARGEST BRANCH OF
PROTESTANTISM, AND THE SOUTHERN BAPTIST CONVENTION IS THE LARGEST
INDIVIDUAL PROTESTANT DENOMINATION. ABOUT 26 PERCENT OF AMERICANS
IDENTIFY AS EVANGELICAL PROTESTANTS, WHILE 18 PERCENT ARE MAINLINE AND
7 PERCENT BELONG TO A TRADITIONALLY BLACK CHURCH. ROMAN CATHOLICISM IN
THE UNITED STATES HAS ITS ORIGIN IN THE SPANISH AND FRENCH
COLONIZATION OF THE AMERICAS, AND LATER GREW DUE TO IRISH, ITALIAN,
POLISH, GERMAN AND HISPANIC IMMIGRATION. RHODE ISLAND IS THE ONLY
STATE WHERE A MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION IS CATHOLIC. LUTHERANISM IN
THE U.S. HAS ITS ORIGIN IN IMMIGRATION FROM NORTHERN EUROPE. NORTH AND
SOUTH DAKOTA ARE THE ONLY STATES IN WHICH A PLURALITY OF THE
POPULATION IS LUTHERAN. UTAH IS THE ONLY STATE WHERE MORMONISM IS THE
RELIGION OF THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION. THE MORMON CORRIDOR ALSO
EXTENDS TO PARTS OF IDAHO, NEVADA AND WYOMING.

THE BIBLE BELT IS AN INFORMAL TERM FOR A REGION IN THE SOUTHERN UNITED
STATES IN WHICH SOCIALLY CONSERVATIVE EVANGELICAL PROTESTANTISM IS A
SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE CULTURE AND CHRISTIAN CHURCH ATTENDANCE ACROSS
THE DENOMINATIONS IS GENERALLY HIGHER THAN THE NATION'S AVERAGE. BY
CONTRAST, RELIGION PLAYS THE LEAST IMPORTANT ROLE IN NEW ENGLAND AND
IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES.[227]

MARRIED.[236] WOMEN NOW WORK MOSTLY OUTSIDE THE HOME AND RECEIVE A
MAJORITY OF BACHELOR'S DEGREES.[237]

THE U.S. TEENAGE PREGNANCY RATE, 79.8 PER 1,000 WOMEN, IS THE HIGHEST
AMONG OECD NATIONS.[238] BETWEEN 2007 AND 2010, THE HIGHEST TEENAGE
BIRTH RATE WAS IN MISSISSIPPI, AND THE LOWEST IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.[239]
ABORTION IS LEGAL THROUGHOUT THE U.S., OWING TO ROE V. WADE, A 1973
LANDMARK DECISION BY THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES. WHILE THE
ABORTION RATE IS FALLING, THE ABORTION RATIO OF 241 PER 1,000 LIVE
BIRTHS AND ABORTION RATE OF 15 PER 1,000 WOMEN AGED 15–44 REMAIN
HIGHER THAN THOSE OF MOST WESTERN NATIONS.[240] IN 2011, THE AVERAGE
AGE AT FIRST BIRTH WAS 25.6 AND 40.7% OF BIRTHS WERE TO UNMARRIED
WOMEN.[241] THE TOTAL FERTILITY RATE (TFR) WAS ESTIMATED FOR 2013 AT
1.86 BIRTHS PER WOMAN.[242] ADOPTION IN THE UNITED STATES IS COMMON
AND RELATIVELY EASY FROM A LEGAL POINT OF VIEW (COMPARED TO OTHER
WESTERN COUNTRIES).[243] IN 2001, WITH OVER 127,000 ADOPTIONS, THE
U.S. ACCOUNTED FOR NEARLY HALF OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ADOPTIONS

UNITED STATES IS THE WORLD'S OLDEST SURVIVING FEDERATION. IT IS A
CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC AND REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY, "IN WHICH
MAJORITY RULE IS TEMPERED BY MINORITY RIGHTS PROTECTED BY LAW".[246]
THE GOVERNMENT IS REGULATED BY A SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES DEFINED
BY THE U.S. CONSTITUTION, WHICH SERVES AS THE COUNTRY'S SUPREME LEGAL
DOCUMENT.[247] FOR 2013, THE U.S. RANKED 19TH ON THE DEMOCRACY
INDEX[248] AND 17TH ON THE CORRUPTION PERCEPTIONS INDEX.[249]

IN THE AMERICAN FEDERALIST SYSTEM, CITIZENS ARE USUALLY SUBJECT TO
THREE LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT: FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL. THE LOCAL
GOVERNMENT'S DUTIES ARE COMMONLY SPLIT BETWEEN COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL
GOVERNMENTS. IN ALMOST ALL CASES, EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE OFFICIALS
ARE ELECTED BY A PLURALITY VOTE OF CITIZENS BY DISTRICT. THERE IS NO
PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, AND IT IS VERY RARE
AT LOWER LEVELS.[250]


POLITICAL SYSTEM OF THE UNITED STATES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS
COMPOSED OF THREE BRANCHES:

LEGISLATIVE: THE BICAMERAL CONGRESS, MADE UP OF THE SENATE AND THE
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, MAKES FEDERAL LAW, DECLARES WAR, APPROVES
TREATIES, HAS THE POWER OF THE PURSE,[251] AND HAS THE POWER OF
IMPEACHMENT, BY WHICH IT CAN REMOVE SITTING MEMBERS OF THE
GOVERNMENT.[252] EXECUTIVE: THE PRESIDENT IS THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF
THE MILITARY, CAN VETO LEGISLATIVE BILLS BEFORE THEY BECOME LAW
(SUBJECT TO CONGRESSIONAL OVERRIDE), AND APPOINTS THE MEMBERS OF THE
CABINET (SUBJECT TO SENATE APPROVAL) AND OTHER OFFICERS, WHO
ADMINISTER AND ENFORCE FEDERAL LAWS AND POLICIES.[253] JUDICIAL: THE
SUPREME COURT AND LOWER FEDERAL COURTS, WHOSE JUDGES ARE APPOINTED BY
THE PRESIDENT WITH SENATE APPROVAL, INTERPRET LAWS AND OVERTURN THOSE
THEY FIND UNCONSTITUTIONAL.[254] THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HAS 435
VOTING MEMBERS, EACH REPRESENTING A CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT FOR A TWO-
YEAR TERM. HOUSE SEATS ARE APPORTIONED AMONG THE STATES BY POPULATION
EVERY TENTH YEAR. AT THE 2010 CENSUS, SEVEN STATES HAD THE MINIMUM OF
ONE REPRESENTATIVE, WHILE CALIFORNIA, THE MOST POPULOUS STATE, HAD
53.[255]

THE SENATE HAS 100 MEMBERS WITH EACH STATE HAVING TWO SENATORS,
ELECTED AT-LARGE TO SIX-YEAR TERMS; ONE THIRD OF SENATE SEATS ARE UP
FOR ELECTION EVERY OTHER YEAR. THE PRESIDENT SERVES A FOUR-YEAR TERM
AND MAY BE ELECTED TO THE OFFICE NO MORE THAN TWICE. THE PRESIDENT IS
NOT ELECTED BY DIRECT VOTE, BUT BY AN INDIRECT ELECTORAL COLLEGE
SYSTEM IN WHICH THE DETERMINING VOTES ARE APPORTIONED TO THE STATES
AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.[256] THE SUPREME COURT, LED BY THE CHIEF
JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES, HAS NINE MEMBERS, WHO SERVE FOR
LIFE.[257]

THE STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE STRUCTURED IN ROUGHLY SIMILAR FASHION;
NEBRASKA UNIQUELY HAS A UNICAMERAL LEGISLATURE.[258] THE GOVERNOR
(CHIEF EXECUTIVE) OF EACH STATE IS DIRECTLY ELECTED. SOME STATE JUDGES
AND CABINET OFFICERS ARE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNORS OF THE RESPECTIVE
STATES, WHILE OTHERS ARE ELECTED BY POPULAR VOTE.

THE ORIGINAL TEXT OF THE CONSTITUTION ESTABLISHES THE STRUCTURE AND
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH
THE INDIVIDUAL STATES. ARTICLE ONE PROTECTS THE RIGHT TO THE "GREAT
WRIT" OF HABEAS CORPUS. THE CONSTITUTION HAS BEEN AMENDED 27
TIMES;[259] THE FIRST TEN AMENDMENTS, WHICH MAKE UP THE BILL OF
RIGHTS, AND THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT FORM THE CENTRAL BASIS OF
AMERICANS' INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. ALL LAWS AND GOVERNMENTAL PROCEDURES ARE
SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW AND ANY LAW RULED BY THE COURTS TO BE IN
VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION IS VOIDED. THE PRINCIPLE OF JUDICIAL
REVIEW, NOT EXPLICITLY MENTIONED IN THE CONSTITUTION, WAS ESTABLISHED
BY THE SUPREME COURT IN MARBURY V. MADISON (1803)[260] IN A DECISION
HANDED DOWN BY CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN MARSHALL.[261]

STATES, U.S. STATE, TERRITORIES OF THE UNITED STATES AND LIST OF
STATES AND TERRITORIES OF THE UNITED STATES FURTHER INFORMATION:
TERRITORIAL EVOLUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND UNITED STATES
TERRITORIAL ACQUISITIONS THE UNITED STATES IS A FEDERAL UNION OF 50
STATES. THE ORIGINAL 13 STATES WERE THE SUCCESSORS OF THE 13 COLONIES
THAT REBELLED AGAINST BRITISH RULE. EARLY IN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY,
THREE NEW STATES WERE ORGANIZED ON TERRITORY SEPARATED FROM THE CLAIMS
OF THE EXISTING STATES: KENTUCKY FROM VIRGINIA; TENNESSEE FROM NORTH
CAROLINA; AND MAINE FROM MASSACHUSETTS. MOST OF THE OTHER STATES HAVE
BEEN CARVED FROM TERRITORIES OBTAINED THROUGH WAR OR PURCHASE BY THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT. ONE SET OF EXCEPTIONS INCLUDES VERMONT, TEXAS, AND
HAWAII: EACH WAS A WELL-ESTABLISHED INDEPENDENT REPUBLIC BEFORE
JOINING THE UNION. DURING THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR, WEST VIRGINIA BROKE
AWAY FROM VIRGINIA. THE MOST RECENT STATE—HAWAII—ACHIEVED STATEHOOD ON
AUGUST 21, 1959.[262] THE STATES DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO UNILATERALLY
SECEDE FROM THE UNION.[263]

THE STATES COMPOSE THE VAST BULK OF THE U.S. LAND MASS. THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA IS A FEDERAL DISTRICT WHICH CONTAINS THE CAPITAL OF THE
UNITED STATES, WASHINGTON, D.C. THE UNITED STATES ALSO POSSESSES FIVE
MAJOR OVERSEAS TERRITORIES: PUERTO RICO AND THE UNITED STATES VIRGIN
ISLANDS IN THE CARIBBEAN; AND AMERICAN SAMOA, GUAM, AND THE NORTHERN
MARIANA ISLANDS IN THE PACIFIC.[264] THOSE BORN IN THE MAJOR
TERRITORIES ARE BIRTHRIGHT U.S. CITIZENS EXCEPT SAMOANS. SAMOANS BORN
IN AMERICAN SAMOA ARE BORN U.S. NATIONALS, AND MAY BECOME NATURALIZED
CITIZENS.[265] AMERICAN CITIZENS RESIDING IN THE TERRITORIES HAVE
FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS AND ELECTIVE SELF-GOVERNMENT,
WITH A TERRITORIAL MEMBER OF CONGRESS, BUT THEY DO NOT VOTE FOR
PRESIDENT AS STATES. TERRITORIES HAVE PERSONAL AND BUSINESS TAX
REGIMES DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF STATES.[266]

THE UNITED STATES ALSO OBSERVES TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY OF THE NATIVE
NATIONS. THOUGH RESERVATIONS ARE WITHIN STATE BORDERS, THE RESERVATION
IS A SOVEREIGN ENTITY. WHILE THE UNITED STATES RECOGNIZES THIS
SOVEREIGNTY, OTHER COUNTRIES MAY NOT.[267]

[SHOW]  STATEHOOD PARTIES AND ELECTIONS MAIN ARTICLES: POLITICS OF THE
UNITED STATES AND POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES IN THE UNITED STATES

(FROM LEFT TO RIGHT) HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER ERIC CANTOR, HOUSE MINORITY
LEADER NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER, PRESIDENT BARACK
OBAMA, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID, AND SENATE MINORITY LEADER
MITCH MCCONNELL AT THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2011 THE UNITED STATES HAS
OPERATED UNDER A TWO-PARTY SYSTEM FOR MOST OF ITS HISTORY.[268] FOR
ELECTIVE OFFICES AT MOST LEVELS, STATE-ADMINISTERED PRIMARY ELECTIONS
CHOOSE THE MAJOR PARTY NOMINEES FOR SUBSEQUENT GENERAL ELECTIONS.
SINCE THE GENERAL ELECTION OF 1856, THE MAJOR PARTIES HAVE BEEN THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, FOUNDED IN 1824, AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, FOUNDED
IN 1854. SINCE THE CIVIL WAR, ONLY ONE THIRD-PARTY PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE—FORMER PRESIDENT THEODORE ROOSEVELT, RUNNING AS A
PROGRESSIVE IN 1912—HAS WON AS MUCH AS 20% OF THE POPULAR VOTE. THE
THIRD-LARGEST POLITICAL PARTY IS THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY. THE PRESIDENT
AND VICE-PRESIDENT ARE ELECTED THROUGH THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SYSTEM.

WITHIN AMERICAN POLITICAL CULTURE, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS CONSIDERED
CENTER-RIGHT OR CONSERVATIVE AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS CONSIDERED
CENTER-LEFT OR LIBERAL.[269] THE STATES OF THE NORTHEAST AND WEST
COAST AND SOME OF THE GREAT LAKES STATES, KNOWN AS "BLUE STATES", ARE
RELATIVELY LIBERAL. THE "RED STATES" OF THE SOUTH AND PARTS OF THE
GREAT PLAINS AND ROCKY MOUNTAINS ARE RELATIVELY CONSERVATIVE.

THE WINNER OF THE 2008 AND 2012 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, DEMOCRAT
BARACK OBAMA, IS THE 44TH U.S. PRESIDENT.

IN THE 114TH UNITED STATES CONGRESS, BOTH THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
AND THE SENATE ARE CONTROLLED BY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THE SENATE
CURRENTLY CONSISTS OF 54 REPUBLICANS, AND 44 DEMOCRATS WITH TWO
INDEPENDENTS WHO CAUCUS WITH THE DEMOCRATS; THE HOUSE CONSISTS OF 246
REPUBLICANS AND 188 DEMOCRATS, WITH ONE VACANCY.[270] IN STATE
GOVERNORSHIPS, THERE ARE 31 REPUBLICANS, 18 DEMOCRATS AND ONE
INDEPENDENT.[271] AMONG THE DC MAYOR AND THE 5 TERRITORIAL GOVERNORS,
THERE ARE 2 REPUBLICANS, 2 DEMOCRATS (ONE IS ALSO IN THE PPD), AND 2
INDEPENDENTS.[272]

SINCE THE FOUNDING OF THE UNITED STATES UNTIL THE 2000S, THE COUNTRY'S
GOVERNANCE HAS BEEN PRIMARILY DOMINATED BY WHITE ANGLO-SAXON
PROTESTANTS (WASPS). HOWEVER, THE SITUATION HAS CHANGED RECENTLY AND
OF THE TOP 17 POSITIONS (FOUR NATIONAL CANDIDATES OF THE TWO MAJOR
PARTY IN THE 2012 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, FOUR LEADERS IN 112TH UNITED
STATES CONGRESS, AND NINE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES) THERE IS ONLY ONE
WASP.[273][274][275]


THE UNITED NATIONS HEADQUARTERS HAS BEEN SITUATED IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN
SINCE 1952. FOREIGN RELATIONS MAIN ARTICLES: FOREIGN RELATIONS OF THE
UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES SEE ALSO: COVERT
UNITED STATES FOREIGN REGIME CHANGE ACTIONS THE UNITED STATES HAS AN
ESTABLISHED STRUCTURE OF FOREIGN RELATIONS. IT IS A PERMANENT MEMBER
OF THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL, AND NEW YORK CITY IS HOME TO
THE UNITED NATIONS HEADQUARTERS. IT IS A MEMBER OF THE G7,[276] G20,
AND ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT. ALMOST ALL
COUNTRIES HAVE EMBASSIES IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AND MANY HAVE CONSULATES
AROUND THE COUNTRY. LIKEWISE, NEARLY ALL NATIONS HOST AMERICAN
DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS. HOWEVER, CUBA, IRAN, NORTH KOREA, BHUTAN, AND THE
REPUBLIC OF CHINA (TAIWAN) DO NOT HAVE FORMAL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS
WITH THE UNITED STATES (ALTHOUGH THE U.S. STILL SUPPLIES TAIWAN WITH
MILITARY EQUIPMENT).[277]

THE UNITED STATES HAS A "SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP" WITH THE UNITED
KINGDOM[278] AND STRONG TIES WITH CANADA,[279] AUSTRALIA,[280] NEW
ZEALAND,[281] THE PHILIPPINES,[282] JAPAN,[283] SOUTH KOREA,[284]
ISRAEL,[285] AND SEVERAL EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES, INCLUDING FRANCE,
ITALY, GERMANY, AND SPAIN. IT WORKS CLOSELY WITH FELLOW NATO MEMBERS
ON MILITARY AND SECURITY ISSUES AND WITH ITS NEIGHBORS THROUGH THE
ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES AND FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS SUCH AS THE
TRILATERAL NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH CANADA AND MEXICO.
IN 2008, THE UNITED STATES SPENT A NET $25.4 BILLION ON OFFICIAL
DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE, THE MOST IN THE WORLD. AS A SHARE OF AMERICA'S
LARGE GROSS NATIONAL INCOME (GNI), HOWEVER, THE U.S. CONTRIBUTION OF
0.18% RANKED LAST AMONG 22 DONOR STATES. BY CONTRAST, PRIVATE OVERSEAS
GIVING BY AMERICANS IS RELATIVELY GENEROUS.[286]

THE U.S. EXERCISES FULL INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORITY AND
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THREE SOVEREIGN NATIONS THROUGH COMPACT OF FREE
ASSOCIATION WITH MICRONESIA, THE MARSHALL ISLANDS AND PALAU, ALL OF
WHICH ARE PACIFIC ISLAND NATIONS WHICH WERE PART OF THE
U.S.-ADMINISTERED TRUST TERRITORY OF THE PACIFIC ISLANDS BEGINNING
AFTER WORLD WAR II, AND GAINED INDEPENDENCE IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS.[287]

GOVERNMENT FINANCE SEE ALSO: TAXATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND UNITED
STATES FEDERAL BUDGET TAXES ARE LEVIED IN THE UNITED STATES AT THE
FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. THESE INCLUDE TAXES ON
INCOME, PAYROLL, PROPERTY, SALES, IMPORTS, ESTATES AND GIFTS, AS WELL
AS VARIOUS FEES. IN 2010 TAXES COLLECTED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS AMOUNTED TO 24.8% OF GDP.[288] DURING FY2012,
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COLLECTED APPROXIMATELY $2.45 TRILLION IN TAX
REVENUE, UP $147 BILLION OR 6% VERSUS FY2011 REVENUES OF $2.30
TRILLION. PRIMARY RECEIPT CATEGORIES INCLUDED INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES
($1,132B OR 47%), SOCIAL SECURITY/SOCIAL INSURANCE TAXES ($845B OR
35%), AND CORPORATE TAXES ($242B OR 10%).[289]

U.S. TAXATION IS GENERALLY PROGRESSIVE, ESPECIALLY THE FEDERAL INCOME
TAXES, AND IS AMONG THE MOST PROGRESSIVE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD,[290]
BUT THE INCIDENCE OF CORPORATE INCOME TAX HAS BEEN A MATTER OF
CONSIDERABLE ONGOING CONTROVERSY FOR DECADES.[291][292] IN 2009 THE
TOP 10% OF EARNERS, WITH 36% OF THE NATION'S INCOME, PAID 78.2% OF THE
FEDERAL PERSONAL INCOME TAX BURDEN, WHILE THE BOTTOM 40% HAD A
NEGATIVE LIABILITY.[293] HOWEVER, PAYROLL TAXES FOR SOCIAL SECURITY
ARE A FLAT REGRESSIVE TAX, WITH NO TAX CHARGED ON INCOME ABOVE
$113,700 AND NO TAX AT ALL PAID ON UNEARNED INCOME FROM THINGS SUCH AS
STOCKS AND CAPITAL GAINS.[294][295] THE HISTORIC REASONING FOR THE
REGRESSIVE NATURE OF THE PAYROLL TAX IS THAT ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS HAVE
NOT BEEN VIEWED AS WELFARE TRANSFERS.[296][297] THE TOP 10% PAID 51.8%
OF TOTAL FEDERAL TAXES IN 2009, AND THE TOP 1%, WITH 13.4% OF PRE-TAX
NATIONAL INCOME, PAID 22.3% OF FEDERAL TAXES.[293] IN 2013 THE TAX
POLICY CENTER PROJECTED TOTAL FEDERAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATES OF 35.5% FOR
THE TOP 1%, 27.2% FOR THE TOP QUINTILE, 13.8% FOR THE MIDDLE QUINTILE,
AND −2.7% FOR THE BOTTOM QUINTILE.[298][299] STATE AND LOCAL TAXES
VARY WIDELY, BUT ARE GENERALLY LESS PROGRESSIVE THAN FEDERAL TAXES AS
THEY RELY HEAVILY ON BROADLY BORNE REGRESSIVE SALES AND PROPERTY TAXES
THAT YIELD LESS VOLATILE REVENUE STREAMS, THOUGH THEIR CONSIDERATION
DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE PROGRESSIVE NATURE OF OVERALL
TAXATION.[292][300]

DURING FY 2012, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPENT $3.54 TRILLION ON A
BUDGET OR CASH BASIS, DOWN $60 BILLION OR 1.7% VS. FY 2011 SPENDING OF
$3.60 TRILLION. MAJOR CATEGORIES OF FY 2012 SPENDING INCLUDED:
MEDICARE & MEDICAID ($802B OR 23% OF SPENDING), SOCIAL SECURITY ($768B
OR 22%), DEFENSE DEPARTMENT ($670B OR 19%), NON-DEFENSE DISCRETIONARY
($615B OR 17%), OTHER MANDATORY ($461B OR 13%) AND INTEREST ($223B OR
6%).[289]

NATIONAL DEBT

US FEDERAL DEBT HELD BY THE PUBLIC AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP, FROM 1790
TO 2013 MAIN ARTICLE: NATIONAL DEBT OF THE UNITED STATES THE TOTAL
NATIONAL DEBT IN THE UNITED STATES WAS $18.527 TRILLION (106% OF THE
GDP), ACCORDING TO AN ESTIMATE FOR 2014 BY THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY
FUND.[301] IN JANUARY 2015, U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DEBT HELD BY THE
PUBLIC WAS APPROXIMATELY $13 TRILLION, OR ABOUT 72% OF U.S. GDP.
INTRA-GOVERNMENTAL HOLDINGS STOOD AT $5 TRILLION, GIVING A COMBINED
TOTAL DEBT OF $18.080 TRILLION.[302][303] BY 2012, TOTAL FEDERAL DEBT
HAD SURPASSED 100% OF U.S. GDP.[304] THE U.S. HAS A CREDIT RATING OF
AA+ FROM STANDARD & POOR'S, AAA FROM FITCH, AND AAA FROM MOODY'S.[305]

HISTORICALLY, THE U.S. PUBLIC DEBT AS A SHARE OF GDP INCREASED DURING
WARS AND RECESSIONS, AND SUBSEQUENTLY DECLINED. FOR EXAMPLE, DEBT HELD
BY THE PUBLIC AS A SHARE OF GDP PEAKED JUST AFTER WORLD WAR II (113%
OF GDP IN 1945), BUT THEN FELL OVER THE FOLLOWING 30 YEARS. IN RECENT
DECADES, LARGE BUDGET DEFICITS AND THE RESULTING INCREASES IN DEBT
HAVE LED TO CONCERN ABOUT THE LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT'S FISCAL POLICIES.[306] HOWEVER, THESE CONCERNS ARE NOT
UNIVERSALLY SHARED.[307]

MILITARY MAIN ARTICLE: UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES

THE CARRIER STRIKE GROUPS OF THE KITTY HAWK, RONALD REAGAN, AND
ABRAHAM LINCOLN WITH AIRCRAFT FROM THE MARINE CORPS, NAVY, AND AIR
FORCE.

DAVIS-MONTHAN AIR FORCE BASE, TUCSON, ARIZONA (FEBRUARY 4, 2004) THE
PRESIDENT HOLDS THE TITLE OF COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE NATION'S ARMED
FORCES AND APPOINTS ITS LEADERS, THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AND THE
JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF. THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
ADMINISTERS THE ARMED FORCES, INCLUDING THE ARMY, NAVY, MARINE CORPS,
AND AIR FORCE. THE COAST GUARD IS RUN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY IN PEACETIME AND BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY DURING TIMES
OF WAR. IN 2008, THE ARMED FORCES HAD 1.4 MILLION PERSONNEL ON ACTIVE
DUTY. THE RESERVES AND NATIONAL GUARD BROUGHT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF
TROOPS TO 2.3 MILLION. THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ALSO EMPLOYED ABOUT
700,000 CIVILIANS, NOT INCLUDING CONTRACTORS.[308]

MILITARY SERVICE IS VOLUNTARY, THOUGH CONSCRIPTION MAY OCCUR IN
WARTIME THROUGH THE SELECTIVE SERVICE SYSTEM.[309] AMERICAN FORCES CAN
BE RAPIDLY DEPLOYED BY THE AIR FORCE'S LARGE FLEET OF TRANSPORT
AIRCRAFT, THE NAVY'S 10 ACTIVE AIRCRAFT CARRIERS, AND MARINE
EXPEDITIONARY UNITS AT SEA WITH THE NAVY'S ATLANTIC AND PACIFIC
FLEETS. THE MILITARY OPERATES 865 BASES AND FACILITIES ABROAD,[310]
AND MAINTAINS DEPLOYMENTS GREATER THAN 100 ACTIVE DUTY PERSONNEL IN 25
FOREIGN COUNTRIES.[311] THE EXTENT OF THIS GLOBAL MILITARY PRESENCE
HAS PROMPTED SOME SCHOLARS TO DESCRIBE THE UNITED STATES AS
MAINTAINING AN "EMPIRE OF BASES".[312]

THE MILITARY BUDGET OF THE UNITED STATES IN 2011 WAS MORE THAN $700
BILLION, 41% OF GLOBAL MILITARY SPENDING AND EQUAL TO THE NEXT 14
LARGEST NATIONAL MILITARY EXPENDITURES COMBINED. AT 4.7% OF GDP, THE
RATE WAS THE SECOND-HIGHEST AMONG THE TOP 15 MILITARY SPENDERS, AFTER
SAUDI ARABIA.[313] U.S. DEFENSE SPENDING AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP RANKED
23RD GLOBALLY IN 2012 ACCORDING TO THE CIA.[314] DEFENSE'S SHARE OF
U.S. SPENDING HAS GENERALLY DECLINED IN RECENT DECADES, FROM COLD WAR
PEAKS OF 14.2% OF GDP IN 1953 AND 69.5% OF FEDERAL OUTLAYS IN 1954 TO
4.7% OF GDP AND 18.8% OF FEDERAL OUTLAYS IN 2011.[315]

THE PROPOSED BASE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BUDGET FOR 2012, $553 BILLION,
WAS A 4.2% INCREASE OVER 2011; AN ADDITIONAL $118 BILLION WAS PROPOSED
FOR THE MILITARY CAMPAIGNS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.[316] THE LAST
AMERICAN TROOPS SERVING IN IRAQ DEPARTED IN DECEMBER 2011;[317] 4,484
SERVICE MEMBERS WERE KILLED DURING THE IRAQ WAR.[318] APPROXIMATELY
90,000 U.S. TROOPS WERE SERVING IN AFGHANISTAN IN APRIL 2012;[319] BY
NOVEMBER 8, 2013 2,285 HAD BEEN KILLED DURING THE WAR IN
AFGHANISTAN.[320]

LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CRIME MAIN ARTICLES: LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE UNITED
STATES AND CRIME IN THE UNITED STATES SEE ALSO: LAW OF THE UNITED
STATES, CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN THE UNITED STATES, SECOND AMENDMENT TO
THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES §
JUSTICE SYSTEM

LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE U.S. IS MAINTAINED PRIMARILY BY LOCAL POLICE
DEPARTMENTS. THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT (NYPD) IS THE LARGEST
IN THE COUNTRY.[321] LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES IS PRIMARILY
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LOCAL POLICE AND SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS, WITH
STATE POLICE PROVIDING BROADER SERVICES. FEDERAL AGENCIES SUCH AS THE
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION (FBI) AND THE U.S. MARSHALS SERVICE
HAVE SPECIALIZED DUTIES, INCLUDING PROTECTING CIVIL RIGHTS, NATIONAL
SECURITY AND ENFORCING U.S. FEDERAL COURTS' RULINGS AND FEDERAL
LAWS.[322] AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND IN ALMOST EVERY STATE, A LEGAL
SYSTEM OPERATES ON A COMMON LAW. STATE COURTS CONDUCT MOST CRIMINAL
TRIALS; FEDERAL COURTS HANDLE CERTAIN DESIGNATED CRIMES AS WELL AS
CERTAIN APPEALS FROM THE STATE CRIMINAL COURTS. PLEA BARGAINING IN THE
UNITED STATES IS VERY COMMON; THE VAST MAJORITY OF CRIMINAL CASES IN
THE COUNTRY ARE SETTLED BY PLEA BARGAIN RATHER THAN JURY
TRIAL.[323][324]

IN 2012 THERE WERE 4.7 MURDERS PER 100,000 PERSONS IN THE UNITED
STATES, A 54% DECLINE FROM THE MODERN PEAK OF 10.2 IN
1980.[325][326][327] AMONG DEVELOPED NATIONS, THE UNITED STATES HAS
ABOVE-AVERAGE LEVELS OF VIOLENT CRIME AND PARTICULARLY HIGH LEVELS OF
GUN VIOLENCE AND HOMICIDE.[328] A CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION MORTALITY DATABASE FROM 2003 SHOWED THAT
UNITED STATES "HOMICIDE RATES WERE 6.9 TIMES HIGHER THAN RATES IN THE
OTHER HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES, DRIVEN BY FIREARM HOMICIDE RATES THAT
WERE 19.5 TIMES HIGHER."[329] GUN OWNERSHIP RIGHTS CONTINUE TO BE THE
SUBJECT OF CONTENTIOUS POLITICAL DEBATE. THE FBI'S UNIFORM CRIME
REPORTS ESTIMATES THAT THERE WERE 3,246 VIOLENT AND PROPERTY CRIMES
PER 100,000 RESIDENTS IN 2012, FOR A TOTAL OF OVER 9 MILLION TOTAL
CRIMES.[330]

CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS SANCTIONED IN THE UNITED STATES FOR CERTAIN
FEDERAL AND MILITARY CRIMES, AND USED IN 32 STATES.[331] NO EXECUTIONS
TOOK PLACE FROM 1967 TO 1977, OWING IN PART TO A U.S. SUPREME COURT
RULING STRIKING DOWN ARBITRARY IMPOSITION OF THE DEATH PENALTY. IN
1976, THAT COURT RULED THAT, UNDER APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES, CAPITAL
PUNISHMENT MAY CONSTITUTIONALLY BE IMPOSED. SINCE THE DECISION THERE
HAVE BEEN MORE THAN 1,300 EXECUTIONS, A MAJORITY OF THESE TAKING PLACE
IN THREE STATES: TEXAS, VIRGINIA, AND OKLAHOMA.[332] MEANWHILE,
SEVERAL STATES HAVE EITHER ABOLISHED OR STRUCK DOWN DEATH PENALTY
LAWS. IN 2010, THE COUNTRY HAD THE FIFTH HIGHEST NUMBER OF EXECUTIONS
IN THE WORLD, FOLLOWING CHINA, IRAN, NORTH KOREA, AND YEMEN.[333]

THE UNITED STATES HAS THE HIGHEST DOCUMENTED INCARCERATION RATE AND
TOTAL PRISON POPULATION IN THE WORLD.[334][335][336][337] AT THE START
OF 2008, MORE THAN 2.3 MILLION PEOPLE WERE INCARCERATED, MORE THAN ONE
IN EVERY 100 ADULTS.[338] THE PRISON POPULATION HAS QUADRUPLED SINCE
1980.[339] AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALES ARE JAILED AT ABOUT SIX TIMES THE
RATE OF WHITE MALES AND THREE TIMES THE RATE OF HISPANIC MALES.[340]
THE COUNTRY'S HIGH RATE OF INCARCERATION IS LARGELY DUE TO CHANGES IN
SENTENCING GUIDELINES AND DRUG POLICIES.[341] IN 2008, LOUISIANA HAD
THE HIGHEST INCARCERATION RATE, AND MAINE THE LOWEST.[342] IN 2012,
LOUISIANA HAD THE HIGHEST RATE OF MURDER AND NON-NEGLIGENT
MANSLAUGHTER IN THE U.S., AND NEW HAMPSHIRE THE LOWEST.[343]

UNITED STATES EXPORT TREEMAP (2011): THE U.S. IS THE WORLD'S SECOND-
LARGEST EXPORTER. THE UNITED STATES HAS A CAPITALIST MIXED ECONOMY
WHICH IS FUELED BY ABUNDANT NATURAL RESOURCES AND HIGH
PRODUCTIVITY.[352] ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND, THE
U.S. GDP OF $16.8 TRILLION CONSTITUTES 24% OF THE GROSS WORLD PRODUCT
AT MARKET EXCHANGE RATES AND OVER 19% OF THE GROSS WORLD PRODUCT AT
PURCHASING POWER PARITY (PPP).[6] ITS NATIONAL GDP WAS ABOUT 5% LARGER
AT PPP IN 2014 THAN THE EUROPEAN UNION'S, WHOSE POPULATION IS AROUND
62% HIGHER.[353] HOWEVER, THE US'S NOMINAL GDP IS ESTIMATED TO BE
$17.528 TRILLION AS OF 2014, WHICH IS ABOUT 5% SMALLER THAN THAT OF
THE EUROPEAN UNION.[354] FROM 1983 TO 2008, U.S. REAL COMPOUNDED
ANNUAL GDP GROWTH WAS 3.3%, COMPARED TO A 2.3% WEIGHTED AVERAGE FOR
THE REST OF THE G7.[355] THE COUNTRY RANKS NINTH IN THE WORLD IN
NOMINAL GDP PER CAPITA AND SIXTH IN GDP PER CAPITA AT PPP.[6] THE U.S.
DOLLAR IS THE WORLD'S PRIMARY RESERVE CURRENCY.[356]

THE UNITED STATES IS THE LARGEST IMPORTER OF GOODS AND SECOND LARGEST
EXPORTER, THOUGH EXPORTS PER CAPITA ARE RELATIVELY LOW. IN 2010, THE
TOTAL U.S. TRADE DEFICIT WAS $635 BILLION.[357] CANADA, CHINA, MEXICO,
JAPAN, AND GERMANY ARE ITS TOP TRADING PARTNERS.[358] IN 2010, OIL WAS
THE LARGEST IMPORT COMMODITY, WHILE TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT WAS THE
COUNTRY'S LARGEST EXPORT.[357] CHINA IS THE LARGEST FOREIGN HOLDER OF
U.S. PUBLIC DEBT.[359] THE LARGEST HOLDER OF THE U.S. DEBT ARE
AMERICAN ENTITIES, INCLUDING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTS AND THE
FEDERAL RESERVE, WHO HOLD THE MAJORITY OF THE
DEBT.[360][361][362][363]

IN 2009, THE PRIVATE SECTOR WAS ESTIMATED TO CONSTITUTE 86.4% OF THE
ECONOMY, WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY ACCOUNTING FOR 4.3% AND
STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY (INCLUDING FEDERAL TRANSFERS) THE
REMAINING 9.3%.[364] WHILE ITS ECONOMY HAS REACHED A POSTINDUSTRIAL
LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT AND ITS SERVICE SECTOR CONSTITUTES 67.8% OF GDP,
THE UNITED STATES REMAINS AN INDUSTRIAL POWER.[365] THE LEADING
BUSINESS FIELD BY GROSS BUSINESS RECEIPTS IS WHOLESALE AND RETAIL
TRADE; BY NET INCOME IT IS MANUFACTURING.[366] IN THE FRANCHISING
BUSINESS MODEL, MCDONALD'S AND SUBWAY ARE THE TWO MOST RECOGNIZED
BRANDS IN THE WORLD. COCA-COLA IS THE MOST RECOGNIZED SOFT DRINK
COMPANY IN THE WORLD.[367]

CHEMICAL PRODUCTS ARE THE LEADING MANUFACTURING FIELD.[368] THE UNITED
STATES IS THE LARGEST PRODUCER OF OIL IN THE WORLD, AS WELL AS ITS
SECOND LARGEST IMPORTER.[369] IT IS THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF
ELECTRICAL AND NUCLEAR ENERGY, AS WELL AS LIQUID NATURAL GAS, SULFUR,
PHOSPHATES, AND SALT. THE NATIONAL MINING ASSOCIATION PROVIDES DATA
PERTAINING TO COAL AND MINERALS THAT INCLUDE BERYLLIUM, COPPER, LEAD,
MAGNESIUM, ZINC, TITANIUM AND OTHERS.[370][371]

AGRICULTURE ACCOUNTS FOR JUST UNDER 1% OF GDP,[365] THE UNITED STATES
IS THE WORLD'S TOP PRODUCER OF CORN[372] AND SOYBEANS.[373] THE
NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS SERVICE MAINTAINS AGRICULTURAL
STATISTICS FOR PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE PEANUTS, OATS, RYE, WHEAT, RICE,
COTTON, CORN, BARLEY, HAY, SUNFLOWERS, AND OILSEEDS. IN ADDITION, THE
UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA) PROVIDES LIVESTOCK
STATISTICS REGARDING BEEF, POULTRY, PORK, AND DAIRY PRODUCTS. THE
COUNTRY IS THE PRIMARY DEVELOPER AND GROWER OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED
FOOD, REPRESENTING HALF OF THE WORLD'S BIOTECH CROPS.[374]

CONSUMER SPENDING COMPRISES 71% OF THE U.S. ECONOMY IN 2013.[375] IN
AUGUST 2010, THE AMERICAN LABOR FORCE CONSISTED OF 154.1 MILLION
PEOPLE. WITH 21.2 MILLION PEOPLE, GOVERNMENT IS THE LEADING FIELD OF
EMPLOYMENT. THE LARGEST PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT SECTOR IS HEALTH CARE AND
SOCIAL ASSISTANCE, WITH 16.4 MILLION PEOPLE. ABOUT 12% OF WORKERS ARE
UNIONIZED, COMPARED TO 30% IN WESTERN EUROPE.[376] THE WORLD BANK
RANKS THE UNITED STATES FIRST IN THE EASE OF HIRING AND FIRING
WORKERS.[377] THE UNITED STATES IS THE ONLY ADVANCED ECONOMY THAT DOES
NOT GUARANTEE ITS WORKERS PAID VACATION[378] AND IS ONE OF JUST A FEW
COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD WITHOUT PAID FAMILY LEAVE AS A LEGAL RIGHT,
WITH THE OTHERS BEING PAPUA NEW GUINEA, SURINAME AND LIBERIA.[379] IN
2009, THE UNITED STATES HAD THE THIRD HIGHEST WORKFORCE PRODUCTIVITY
PER PERSON IN THE WORLD, BEHIND LUXEMBOURG AND NORWAY. IT WAS FOURTH
IN PRODUCTIVITY PER HOUR, BEHIND THOSE TWO COUNTRIES AND THE
NETHERLANDS.[380]

THE 2008-2012 GLOBAL RECESSION HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE UNITED
STATES, WITH OUTPUT STILL BELOW POTENTIAL ACCORDING TO THE
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE.[381] IT BROUGHT HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT (WHICH
HAS BEEN DECREASING BUT REMAINS ABOVE PRE-RECESSION LEVELS), ALONG
WITH LOW CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, THE CONTINUING DECLINE IN HOME VALUES
AND INCREASE IN FORECLOSURES AND PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES, AN ESCALATING
FEDERAL DEBT CRISIS, INFLATION, AND RISING PETROLEUM AND FOOD PRICES.
THERE REMAINS A RECORD PROPORTION OF LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED, CONTINUED
DECREASING HOUSEHOLD INCOME, AND TAX AND FEDERAL BUDGET
INCREASES.[382][383][384] A 2011 POLL FOUND THAT MORE THAN HALF OF ALL
AMERICANS THINK THE U.S. IS STILL IN RECESSION OR EVEN DEPRESSION,
DESPITE OFFICIAL DATA THAT SHOWS A HISTORICALLY MODEST RECOVERY.[385]
IN 2013 THE CENSUS BUREAU DEFINED POVERTY RATE DECREASED TO ROUGHLY
14.5% OF THE POPULATION.[386]

EMPLOYEE INCOME AMONG OECD NATIONS, AND IN 2007 HAD THE SECOND HIGHEST
MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME.[387][388] ACCORDING TO THE CENSUS BUREAU REAL
MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME WAS $50,502 IN 2011, DOWN FROM $51,144 IN
2010.[389] THE GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY INDEX RANKED THE U.S. NUMBER ONE
FOR FOOD AFFORDABILITY AND OVERALL FOOD SECURITY IN MARCH 2013.[390]
AMERICANS ON AVERAGE HAVE OVER TWICE AS MUCH LIVING SPACE PER DWELLING
AND PER PERSON AS EUROPEAN UNION RESIDENTS, AND MORE THAN EVERY EU
NATION.[391] FOR 2013 THE UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME RANKED
THE UNITED STATES 5TH AMONG 187 COUNTRIES IN ITS HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
INDEX AND 28TH IN ITS INEQUALITY-ADJUSTED HDI (IHDI).[392]

THERE HAS BEEN A WIDENING GAP BETWEEN PRODUCTIVITY AND MEDIAN INCOMES
SINCE THE 1970S.[393] WHILE INFLATION-ADJUSTED ("REAL") HOUSEHOLD
INCOME HAD BEEN INCREASING ALMOST EVERY YEAR FROM 1947 TO 1999, IT HAS
SINCE BEEN FLAT AND EVEN DECREASED RECENTLY.[394] THE RISE IN THE
SHARE OF TOTAL ANNUAL INCOME RECEIVED BY THE TOP 1 PERCENT, WHICH HAS
MORE THAN DOUBLED FROM 9 PERCENT IN 1976 TO 20 PERCENT IN 2011, HAS
HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON INCOME INEQUALITY,[395] LEAVING THE UNITED
STATES WITH ONE OF THE WIDEST INCOME DISTRIBUTIONS AMONG OECD
NATIONS.[396][397][398] THE POST-RECESSION INCOME GAINS HAVE BEEN VERY
UNEVEN, WITH THE TOP 1 PERCENT CAPTURING 95 PERCENT OF THE INCOME
GAINS FROM 2009 TO 2012.[399]

WEALTH, LIKE INCOME AND TAXES, IS HIGHLY CONCENTRATED; THE RICHEST 10%
OF THE ADULT POPULATION POSSESS 72% OF THE COUNTRY'S HOUSEHOLD WEALTH,
WHILE THE BOTTOM HALF CLAIM ONLY 2%.[400] THOSE EARNING IN THE TOP 10%
PAID 49.6% OF ALL FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL TAXES IN 2014.[401]
GROWING INCOME INEQUALITY AND WEALTH CONCENTRATION HAVE RESULTED IN
AFFLUENT INDIVIDUALS, POWERFUL BUSINESS INTERESTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC
ELITES GAINING INCREASED INFLUENCE OVER PUBLIC POLICY.[402][403][404]

SINCE PEAKING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007, HOUSEHOLD WEALTH IS DOWN
$14 TRILLION.[405] AT THE END OF 2008, HOUSEHOLD DEBT AMOUNTED TO
$13.8 TRILLION.[406]

THERE WERE ABOUT 643,000 SHELTERED AND UNSHELTERED HOMELESS PERSONS IN
THE U.S. IN JANUARY 2009, WITH ALMOST TWO-THIRDS STAYING IN AN
EMERGENCY SHELTER OR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM. IN 2011 16.7
MILLION CHILDREN LIVED IN FOOD-INSECURE HOUSEHOLDS, ABOUT 35% MORE
THAN 2007 LEVELS, THOUGH ONLY 1.1% OF U.S. CHILDREN, OR 845,000, SAW
REDUCED FOOD INTAKE OR DISRUPTED EATING PATTERNS AT SOME POINT DURING
THE YEAR, AND MOST CASES WERE NOT CHRONIC.[407] ACCORDING TO A 2014
REPORT BY THE CENSUS BUREAU, ONE IN FIVE YOUNG ADULTS LIVES IN POVERTY
TODAY, UP FROM ONE IN SEVEN IN 1980.[408]

INFRASTRUCTURE TRANSPORTATION MAIN ARTICLE: TRANSPORTATION IN THE
UNITED STATES

THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM, WHICH EXTENDS 46,876 MILES (75,440
KM)[409] PERSONAL TRANSPORTATION IS DOMINATED BY AUTOMOBILES, WHICH
OPERATE ON A NETWORK OF 4 MILLION MILES OF PUBLIC ROADS,[410]
INCLUDING ONE OF THE WORLD'S LONGEST HIGHWAY SYSTEMS.[411] THE WORLD'S
SECOND LARGEST AUTOMOBILE MARKET,[412] THE UNITED STATES HAS THE
HIGHEST RATE OF PER-CAPITA VEHICLE OWNERSHIP IN THE WORLD, WITH 765
VEHICLES PER 1,000 AMERICANS.[413] ABOUT 40% OF PERSONAL VEHICLES ARE
VANS, SUVS, OR LIGHT TRUCKS.[414] THE AVERAGE AMERICAN ADULT
(ACCOUNTING FOR ALL DRIVERS AND NON-DRIVERS) SPENDS 55 MINUTES DRIVING
EVERY DAY, TRAVELING 29 MILES (47 KM).[415]

MASS TRANSIT ACCOUNTS FOR 9% OF TOTAL U.S. WORK TRIPS.[416][417] WHILE
TRANSPORT OF GOODS BY RAIL IS EXTENSIVE, RELATIVELY FEW PEOPLE USE
RAIL TO TRAVEL,[418] THOUGH RIDERSHIP ON AMTRAK, THE NATIONAL
INTERCITY PASSENGER RAIL SYSTEM, GREW BY ALMOST 37% BETWEEN 2000 AND
2010.[419] ALSO, LIGHT RAIL DEVELOPMENT HAS INCREASED IN RECENT
YEARS.[420] BICYCLE USAGE FOR WORK COMMUTES IS MINIMAL.[421]

THE CIVIL AIRLINE INDUSTRY IS ENTIRELY PRIVATELY OWNED AND HAS BEEN
LARGELY DEREGULATED SINCE 1978, WHILE MOST MAJOR AIRPORTS ARE PUBLICLY
OWNED.[422] THE THREE LARGEST AIRLINES IN THE WORLD BY PASSENGERS
CARRIED ARE U.S.-BASED; AMERICAN AIRLINES IS NUMBER ONE AFTER ITS 2013
ACQUISITION BY US AIRWAYS.[423] OF THE WORLD'S 30 BUSIEST PASSENGER
AIRPORTS, 12 ARE IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE BUSIEST,
HARTSFIELD–JACKSON ATLANTA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.[424]

ENERGY

THE HOOVER DAM WHEN COMPLETED IN 1936 WAS BOTH THE WORLD'S LARGEST
ELECTRIC-POWER GENERATING STATION AND THE WORLD'S LARGEST CONCRETE
STRUCTURE. SEE ALSO: ENERGY POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES THE UNITED
STATES ENERGY MARKET IS ABOUT 29,000 TERAWATT HOURS PER YEAR.[425]
ENERGY CONSUMPTION PER CAPITA IS 7.8 TONS OF OIL EQUIVALENT PER YEAR,
THE 10TH HIGHEST RATE IN THE WORLD. IN 2005, 40% OF THIS ENERGY CAME
FROM PETROLEUM, 23% FROM COAL, AND 22% FROM NATURAL GAS. THE REMAINDER
WAS SUPPLIED BY NUCLEAR POWER AND RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES.[426] THE
UNITED STATES IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST CONSUMER OF PETROLEUM.[427]

FOR DECADES, NUCLEAR POWER HAS PLAYED A LIMITED ROLE RELATIVE TO MANY
OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, IN PART BECAUSE OF PUBLIC PERCEPTION IN THE
WAKE OF A 1979 ACCIDENT. IN 2007, SEVERAL APPLICATIONS FOR NEW NUCLEAR
PLANTS WERE FILED.[428] THE UNITED STATES HAS 27% OF GLOBAL COAL
RESERVES.[429] IT IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST PRODUCER OF NATURAL GAS AND
CRUDE OIL.[430]

UNITED STATES

ASTRONAUT JAMES IRWIN WALKING ON THE MOON NEXT TO APOLLO 15'S LANDING
MODULE AND LUNAR ROVER IN 1971. THE EFFORT TO REACH THE MOON WAS
TRIGGERED BY THE SPACE RACE. THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN A LEADER IN
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION SINCE THE LATE 19TH
CENTURY. IN 1876, ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL WAS AWARDED THE FIRST U.S.
PATENT FOR THE TELEPHONE. THOMAS EDISON'S RESEARCH LABORATORY, ONE OF
THE FIRST OF ITS KIND, DEVELOPED THE PHONOGRAPH, THE FIRST LONG-
LASTING LIGHT BULB, AND THE FIRST VIABLE MOVIE CAMERA.[431] THE LATTER
LEAD TO EMERGENCE OF THE WORLDWIDE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. IN THE
EARLY 20TH CENTURY, THE AUTOMOBILE COMPANIES OF RANSOM E. OLDS AND
HENRY FORD POPULARIZED THE ASSEMBLY LINE. THE WRIGHT BROTHERS, IN
1903, MADE THE FIRST SUSTAINED AND CONTROLLED HEAVIER-THAN-AIR POWERED
FLIGHT.[432]

THE RISE OF NAZISM IN THE 1930S LED MANY EUROPEAN SCIENTISTS,
INCLUDING ALBERT EINSTEIN, ENRICO FERMI, AND JOHN VON NEUMANN, TO
IMMIGRATE TO THE UNITED STATES.[433] DURING WORLD WAR II, THE
MANHATTAN PROJECT DEVELOPED NUCLEAR WEAPONS, USHERING IN THE ATOMIC
AGE, WHILE THE SPACE RACE PRODUCED RAPID ADVANCES IN ROCKETRY,
MATERIALS SCIENCE, AND AERONAUTICS.[434][435]

THE INVENTION OF THE TRANSISTOR IN THE 1950S, A KEY ACTIVE COMPONENT
IN PRACTICALLY ALL MODERN ELECTRONICS, LEAD TO MANY TECHNOLOGICAL
DEVELOPMENTS AND A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF THE U.S. TECHNOLOGY
INDUSTRY.[436][437][438] THIS IN TURN LEAD TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF
MANY NEW TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES AND REGIONS AROUND THE COUNTY SUCH AS
SILICON VALLEY IN CALIFORNIA. ADVANCEMENTS BY AMERICAN MICROPROCESSOR
COMPANIES SUCH AS ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES (AMD), AND INTEL ALONG WITH
BOTH COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE COMPANIES THAT INCLUDE ADOBE
SYSTEMS, APPLE COMPUTER, IBM, GNU-LINUX, MICROSOFT, AND SUN
MICROSYSTEMS CREATED AND POPULARIZED THE PERSONAL COMPUTER. THE
ARPANET WAS DEVELOPED IN THE 1960S TO MEET DEFENSE DEPARTMENT
REQUIREMENTS, AND BECAME THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF NETWORKS WHICH
EVOLVED INTO THE INTERNET.

THESE ADVANCEMENTS THEN LEAD TO GREATER PERSONALIZATION OF TECHNOLOGY
FOR INDIVIDUAL USE.[439] AS OF APRIL 2010, 77% OF AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS
OWNED AT LEAST ONE COMPUTER, AND 68% HAD BROADBAND INTERNET
SERVICE.[440] 85% OF AMERICANS ALSO OWN A MOBILE PHONE AS OF
2011.[441]

IN THE 21ST CENTURY, 64% OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING COMES
FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR.[442] THE UNITED STATES LEADS THE WORLD IN
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PAPERS AND IMPACT FACTOR.[443]

EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT IN THE UNITED STATES AND HIGHER EDUCATION IN
THE UNITED STATES

THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, FOUNDED BY THOMAS JEFFERSON IN 1819, IS
ONE OF THE MANY PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. AMERICAN
PUBLIC EDUCATION IS OPERATED BY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, REGULATED
BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THROUGH RESTRICTIONS ON
FEDERAL GRANTS. IN MOST STATES, CHILDREN ARE REQUIRED TO ATTEND SCHOOL
FROM THE AGE OF SIX OR SEVEN (GENERALLY, KINDERGARTEN OR FIRST GRADE)
UNTIL THEY TURN 18 (GENERALLY BRINGING THEM THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE, THE
END OF HIGH SCHOOL); SOME STATES ALLOW STUDENTS TO LEAVE SCHOOL AT 16
OR 17.[444] ABOUT 12% OF CHILDREN ARE ENROLLED IN PAROCHIAL OR
NONSECTARIAN PRIVATE SCHOOLS. JUST OVER 2% OF CHILDREN ARE
HOMESCHOOLED.[445] THE U.S. SPENDS MORE ON EDUCATION PER STUDENT THAN
ANY NATION IN THE WORLD, SPENDING MORE THAN $11,000 PER ELEMENTARY
STUDENT IN 2010 AND MORE THAN $12,000 PER HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT.[446]
SOME 80% OF U.S. COLLEGE STUDENTS ATTEND PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES.[447]

THE UNITED STATES HAS MANY COMPETITIVE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS
OF HIGHER EDUCATION. ACCORDING TO PROMINENT INTERNATIONAL RANKINGS, 13
OR 15 AMERICAN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE RANKED AMONG THE TOP 20
IN THE WORLD.[448][449] THERE ARE ALSO LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITH
GENERALLY MORE OPEN ADMISSION POLICIES, SHORTER ACADEMIC PROGRAMS, AND
LOWER TUITION. OF AMERICANS 25 AND OLDER, 84.6% GRADUATED FROM HIGH
SCHOOL, 52.6% ATTENDED SOME COLLEGE, 27.2% EARNED A BACHELOR'S DEGREE,
AND 9.6% EARNED GRADUATE DEGREES.[450] THE BASIC LITERACY RATE IS
APPROXIMATELY 99%.[159][451] THE UNITED NATIONS ASSIGNS THE UNITED
STATES AN EDUCATION INDEX OF 0.97, TYING IT FOR 12TH IN THE
WORLD.[452]

AS FOR PUBLIC EXPENDITURES ON HIGHER EDUCATION, THE U.S. TRAILS SOME
OTHER OECD NATIONS BUT SPENDS MORE PER STUDENT THAN THE OECD AVERAGE,
AND MORE THAN ALL NATIONS IN COMBINED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE
SPENDING.[446][453] AS OF 2012, STUDENT LOAN DEBT EXCEEDED ONE
TRILLION DOLLARS, MORE THAN AMERICANS OWE ON CREDIT CARDS.[454]

HEALTH SEE ALSO: HEALTH CARE IN THE UNITED STATES, HEALTH CARE REFORM
IN THE UNITED STATES AND HEALTH INSURANCE IN THE UNITED STATES THE
UNITED STATES HAS A LIFE EXPECTANCY OF 78.4 YEARS AT BIRTH, UP FROM
75.2 YEARS IN 1990, RANKING IT 50TH AMONG 221 NATIONS, AND 27TH OUT OF
THE 34 INDUSTRIALIZED OECD COUNTRIES, DOWN FROM 20TH IN
1990.[455][456] INCREASING OBESITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND HEALTH
IMPROVEMENTS ELSEWHERE HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO LOWERING THE COUNTRY'S RANK
IN LIFE EXPECTANCY FROM 1987, WHEN IT WAS 11TH IN THE WORLD.[457]
OBESITY RATES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE AMONG THE HIGHEST IN THE
WORLD.[458] APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF THE ADULT POPULATION IS OBESE
AND AN ADDITIONAL THIRD IS OVERWEIGHT;[459] THE OBESITY RATE, THE
HIGHEST IN THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD, HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN THE LAST
QUARTER-CENTURY.[460] OBESITY-RELATED TYPE 2 DIABETES IS CONSIDERED
EPIDEMIC BY HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS.[461] THE INFANT MORTALITY RATE
OF 6.17 PER THOUSAND PLACES THE UNITED STATES 169TH HIGHEST OUT OF 224
COUNTRIES.[462] THE UNITED STATES HAS THE HIGHEST FIRST-DAY INFANT
DEATH RATE OUT OF ALL THE INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. ABOUT
11,300 NEWBORNS DIE WITHIN 24 HOURS OF THEIR BIRTH IN THE U.S. EACH
YEAR, 50 PERCENT MORE FIRST-DAY DEATHS THAN ALL OTHER INDUSTRIALIZED
COUNTRIES COMBINED.[463]

IN 2010, CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, LUNG CANCER, STROKE, CHRONIC
OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASES, AND TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS CAUSED THE MOST
YEARS OF LIFE LOST IN THE U.S. LOW BACK PAIN, DEPRESSION,
MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS, NECK PAIN, AND ANXIETY CAUSED THE MOST
YEARS LOST TO DISABILITY. THE MOST DELETERIOUS RISK FACTORS WERE POOR
DIET, TOBACCO SMOKING, OBESITY, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, HIGH BLOOD SUGAR,
PHYSICAL INACTIVITY, AND ALCOHOL USE. ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, DRUG ABUSE,
KIDNEY DISEASE AND CANCER, AND FALLS CAUSED THE MOST ADDITIONAL YEARS
OF LIFE LOST OVER THEIR AGE-ADJUSTED 1990 PER-CAPITA RATES.[456] U.S.
UNDERAGE DRINKING AMONG TEENAGERS IS AMONG THE LOWEST IN
INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS.[464]

THE U.S. IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN MEDICAL INNOVATION. AMERICA SOLELY
DEVELOPED OR CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO 9 OF THE TOP 10 MOST
IMPORTANT MEDICAL INNOVATIONS SINCE 1975 AS RANKED BY A 2001 POLL OF
PHYSICIANS, WHILE THE EU AND SWITZERLAND TOGETHER CONTRIBUTED TO FIVE.
SINCE 1966, AMERICANS HAVE RECEIVED MORE NOBEL PRIZES IN MEDICINE THAN
THE REST OF THE WORLD. FROM 1989 TO 2002, FOUR TIMES MORE MONEY WAS
INVESTED IN PRIVATE BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN AMERICA THAN IN
EUROPE.[465][466] THE U.S. HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM FAR OUTSPENDS ANY OTHER
NATION, MEASURED IN BOTH PER CAPITA SPENDING AND PERCENTAGE OF
GDP.[467] HEALTH-CARE COVERAGE IN THE UNITED STATES IS A COMBINATION
OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EFFORTS AND IS NOT UNIVERSAL. IN 2014, 13.4% OF
THE POPULATION DID NOT CARRY HEALTH INSURANCE.[468] THE SUBJECT OF
UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED AMERICANS IS A MAJOR POLITICAL
ISSUE.[469][470] IN 2006, MASSACHUSETTS BECAME THE FIRST STATE TO
MANDATE UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE.[471] FEDERAL LEGISLATION PASSED IN
EARLY 2010 WOULD OSTENSIBLY CREATE A NEAR-UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE
SYSTEM AROUND THE COUNTRY BY 2014, THOUGH THE BILL AND ITS ULTIMATE
IMPACT ARE ISSUES OF CONTROVERSY.[472][473]

NATIVES § CULTURES, NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURES IN THE UNITED STATES,
CULTURE OF THE NATIVE HAWAIIANS, SOCIAL CLASS IN THE UNITED STATES,
PUBLIC HOLIDAYS IN THE UNITED STATES AND TOURISM IN THE UNITED STATES
THE UNITED STATES IS HOME TO MANY CULTURES AND A WIDE VARIETY OF
ETHNIC GROUPS, TRADITIONS, AND VALUES.[19][474] ASIDE FROM THE NATIVE
AMERICAN, NATIVE HAWAIIAN AND NATIVE ALASKAN POPULATIONS, NEARLY ALL
AMERICANS OR THEIR ANCESTORS SETTLED OR IMMIGRATED WITHIN THE PAST
FIVE CENTURIES.[475] MAINSTREAM AMERICAN CULTURE IS A WESTERN CULTURE
LARGELY DERIVED FROM THE TRADITIONS OF EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS WITH
INFLUENCES FROM MANY OTHER SOURCES, SUCH AS TRADITIONS BROUGHT BY
SLAVES FROM AFRICA.[19][476] MORE RECENT IMMIGRATION FROM ASIA AND
ESPECIALLY LATIN AMERICA HAS ADDED TO A CULTURAL MIX THAT HAS BEEN
DESCRIBED AS BOTH A HOMOGENIZING MELTING POT, AND A HETEROGENEOUS
SALAD BOWL IN WHICH IMMIGRANTS AND THEIR DESCENDANTS RETAIN
DISTINCTIVE CULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS.[19]

CORE AMERICAN CULTURE WAS ESTABLISHED BY PROTESTANT BRITISH COLONISTS
AND SHAPED BY THE FRONTIER SETTLEMENT PROCESS, WITH THE TRAITS DERIVED
PASSED DOWN TO DESCENDANTS AND TRANSMITTED TO IMMIGRANTS THROUGH
ASSIMILATION. AMERICANS HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY A
STRONG WORK ETHIC, COMPETITIVENESS, AND INDIVIDUALISM, AS WELL AS A
UNIFYING BELIEF IN AN "AMERICAN CREED" EMPHASIZING LIBERTY, EQUALITY,
PRIVATE PROPERTY, DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW, AND A PREFERENCE FOR LIMITED
GOVERNMENT.[477] AMERICANS ARE EXTREMELY CHARITABLE BY GLOBAL
STANDARDS. ACCORDING TO A 2006 BRITISH STUDY, AMERICANS GAVE 1.67% OF
GDP TO CHARITY, MORE THAN ANY OTHER NATION STUDIED, MORE THAN TWICE
THE SECOND PLACE BRITISH FIGURE OF 0.73%, AND AROUND TWELVE TIMES THE
FRENCH FIGURE OF 0.14%.[478][479]

THE AMERICAN DREAM, OR THE PERCEPTION THAT AMERICANS ENJOY HIGH SOCIAL
MOBILITY, PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN ATTRACTING IMMIGRANTS.[480] WHETHER THIS
PERCEPTION IS REALISTIC HAS BEEN A TOPIC OF
DEBATE.[481][482][483][484][355][485] WHILE MAINSTREAM CULTURE HOLDS
THAT THE UNITED STATES IS A CLASSLESS SOCIETY,[486] SCHOLARS IDENTIFY
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL CLASSES,
AFFECTING SOCIALIZATION, LANGUAGE, AND VALUES.[487] AMERICANS' SELF-
IMAGES, SOCIAL VIEWPOINTS, AND CULTURAL EXPECTATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED
WITH THEIR OCCUPATIONS TO AN UNUSUALLY CLOSE DEGREE.[488] WHILE
AMERICANS TEND GREATLY TO VALUE SOCIOECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENT, BEING
ORDINARY OR AVERAGE IS GENERALLY SEEN AS A POSITIVE ATTRIBUTE.[489]

MASS MEDIA MAIN ARTICLES: MEDIA OF THE UNITED STATES AND TELEVISION IN

CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS OF THE AMERICAN BROADCASTING COMPANY IN NEW
YORK CITY THE FOUR MAJOR BROADCASTERS IN THE U.S. ARE THE NATIONAL
BROADCASTING COMPANY (NBC), COLUMBIA BROADCASTING SYSTEM (CBS), THE
AMERICAN BROADCASTING COMPANY (ABC) AND FOX. AMERICANS ARE THE
HEAVIEST TELEVISION VIEWERS IN THE WORLD,[490] AND THE AVERAGE VIEWING
TIME CONTINUES TO RISE, REACHING FIVE HOURS A DAY IN 2006.[491] THE
FOUR MAJOR BROADCAST TELEVISION NETWORKS ARE ALL COMMERCIAL ENTITIES.
AMERICANS LISTEN TO RADIO PROGRAMMING, ALSO LARGELY COMMERCIAL, ON
AVERAGE JUST OVER TWO-AND-A-HALF HOURS A DAY.[492]

IN 1998, THE NUMBER OF U.S. COMMERCIAL RADIO STATIONS HAD GROWN TO
4,793 AM STATIONS AND 5,662 FM STATIONS. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE 1,460
PUBLIC RADIO STATIONS. MOST OF THESE STATIONS ARE RUN BY UNIVERSITIES
AND PUBLIC AUTHORITIES FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES AND ARE FINANCED BY
PUBLIC AND/OR PRIVATE FUNDS, SUBSCRIPTIONS AND CORPORATE UNDERWRITING.
MUCH PUBLIC-RADIO BROADCASTING IS SUPPLIED BY NPR (FORMERLY NATIONAL
PUBLIC RADIO). NPR WAS INCORPORATED IN FEBRUARY 1970 UNDER THE PUBLIC
BROADCASTING ACT OF 1967; ITS TELEVISION COUNTERPART, PBS, WAS ALSO
CREATED BY THE SAME LEGISLATION. (NPR AND PBS ARE OPERATED SEPARATELY
FROM EACH OTHER.) AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 THERE ARE 15,433 LICENSED
FULL-POWER RADIO STATIONS IN THE US ACCORDING TO THE FCC.[493]

ASIDE FROM WEB PORTALS AND SEARCH ENGINES, THE MOST POPULAR WEBSITES
ARE FACEBOOK, YOUTUBE, WIKIPEDIA, AMAZON, EBAY, AND TWITTER.[494]

WELL-KNOWN NEWSPAPERS ARE THE NEW YORK TIMES, USA TODAY AND THE WALL
STREET JOURNAL. ALTHOUGH THE COST OF PUBLISHING HAS INCREASED OVER THE
YEARS, THE PRICE OF NEWSPAPERS HAS GENERALLY REMAINED LOW, FORCING
NEWSPAPERS TO RELY MORE ON ADVERTISING REVENUE AND ON ARTICLES
PROVIDED BY A MAJOR WIRE SERVICE, SUCH AS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS OR
REUTERS, FOR THEIR NATIONAL AND WORLD COVERAGE. WITH VERY FEW
EXCEPTIONS, ALL THE NEWSPAPERS IN THE U.S. ARE PRIVATELY OWNED, EITHER
BY LARGE CHAINS SUCH AS GANNETT OR MCCLATCHY, WHICH OWN DOZENS OR EVEN
HUNDREDS OF NEWSPAPERS; BY SMALL CHAINS THAT OWN A HANDFUL OF PAPERS;
OR IN A SITUATION THAT IS INCREASINGLY RARE, BY INDIVIDUALS OR
FAMILIES. MAJOR CITIES OFTEN HAVE "ALTERNATIVE WEEKLIES" TO COMPLEMENT
THE MAINSTREAM DAILY PAPER(S), FOR EXAMPLE, NEW YORK CITY'S THE
VILLAGE VOICE OR LOS ANGELES' LA WEEKLY, TO NAME TWO OF THE BEST-
KNOWN. MAJOR CITIES MAY ALSO SUPPORT A LOCAL BUSINESS JOURNAL, TRADE
PAPERS RELATING TO LOCAL INDUSTRIES, AND PAPERS FOR LOCAL ETHNIC AND
SOCIAL GROUPS. EARLY VERSIONS OF THE AMERICAN NEWSPAPER COMIC STRIP
AND THE AMERICAN COMIC BOOK BEGAN APPEARING IN THE 19TH CENTURY. IN
1938, SUPERMAN, THE QUINTESSENTIAL COMIC BOOK SUPERHERO OF DC COMICS,
DEVELOPED INTO AN AMERICAN ICON.[495]

COMMERCIAL SCREENING OF A PROJECTED FILM, ALSO IN NEW YORK, AND THE
UNITED STATES WAS IN THE FOREFRONT OF SOUND FILM'S DEVELOPMENT IN THE
FOLLOWING DECADES. SINCE THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY, THE U.S. FILM
INDUSTRY HAS LARGELY BEEN BASED IN AND AROUND HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA.

DIRECTOR D. W. GRIFFITH WAS CENTRAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FILM GRAMMAR
AND ORSON WELLES'S CITIZEN KANE (1941) IS FREQUENTLY CITED AS THE
GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME.[498][499] AMERICAN SCREEN ACTORS LIKE JOHN
WAYNE AND MARILYN MONROE HAVE BECOME ICONIC FIGURES, WHILE
PRODUCER/ENTREPRENEUR WALT DISNEY WAS A LEADER IN BOTH ANIMATED FILM
AND MOVIE MERCHANDISING. HOLLYWOOD IS ALSO ONE OF THE LEADERS IN
MOTION PICTURE PRODUCTION.[500]

MUSIC MAIN ARTICLE: MUSIC OF THE UNITED STATES THE RHYTHMIC AND
LYRICAL STYLES OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN MUSIC HAVE DEEPLY INFLUENCED
AMERICAN MUSIC AT LARGE, DISTINGUISHING IT FROM EUROPEAN TRADITIONS.
ELEMENTS FROM FOLK IDIOMS SUCH AS THE BLUES AND WHAT IS NOW KNOWN AS
OLD-TIME MUSIC WERE ADOPTED AND TRANSFORMED INTO POPULAR GENRES WITH
GLOBAL AUDIENCES. JAZZ WAS DEVELOPED BY INNOVATORS SUCH AS LOUIS
ARMSTRONG AND DUKE ELLINGTON EARLY IN THE 20TH CENTURY. COUNTRY MUSIC
DEVELOPED IN THE 1920S, AND RHYTHM AND BLUES IN THE 1940S.[501]

ELVIS PRESLEY AND CHUCK BERRY WERE AMONG THE MID-1950S PIONEERS OF
ROCK AND ROLL. IN THE 1960S, BOB DYLAN EMERGED FROM THE FOLK REVIVAL
TO BECOME ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST CELEBRATED SONGWRITERS AND JAMES BROWN
LED THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUNK. MORE RECENT AMERICAN CREATIONS INCLUDE
HIP HOP AND HOUSE MUSIC. AMERICAN POP STARS SUCH AS PRESLEY, MICHAEL
JACKSON, AND MADONNA HAVE BECOME GLOBAL CELEBRITIES.[501]

MARK TWAIN, AMERICAN AUTHOR AND HUMORIST IN THE 18TH AND EARLY 19TH
CENTURIES, AMERICAN ART AND LITERATURE TOOK MOST OF ITS CUES FROM
EUROPE. WRITERS SUCH AS NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE, EDGAR ALLAN POE, AND
HENRY DAVID THOREAU ESTABLISHED A DISTINCTIVE AMERICAN LITERARY VOICE
BY THE MIDDLE OF THE 19TH CENTURY. MARK TWAIN AND POET WALT WHITMAN
WERE MAJOR FIGURES IN THE CENTURY'S SECOND HALF; EMILY DICKINSON,
VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN DURING HER LIFETIME, IS NOW RECOGNIZED AS AN
ESSENTIAL AMERICAN POET.[502] A WORK SEEN AS CAPTURING FUNDAMENTAL
ASPECTS OF THE NATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND CHARACTER—SUCH AS HERMAN
MELVILLE'S MOBY-DICK (1851), TWAIN'S THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY
FINN (1885), AND F. SCOTT FITZGERALD'S THE GREAT GATSBY (1925)—MAY BE
DUBBED THE "GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL".[503]

ELEVEN U.S. CITIZENS HAVE WON THE NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE, MOST
RECENTLY TONI MORRISON IN 1993. WILLIAM FAULKNER AND ERNEST HEMINGWAY
ARE OFTEN NAMED AMONG THE MOST INFLUENTIAL WRITERS OF THE 20TH
CENTURY.[504] POPULAR LITERARY GENRES SUCH AS THE WESTERN AND
HARDBOILED CRIME FICTION DEVELOPED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE BEAT
GENERATION WRITERS OPENED UP NEW LITERARY APPROACHES, AS HAVE
POSTMODERNIST AUTHORS SUCH AS JOHN BARTH, THOMAS PYNCHON, AND DON
DELILLO.

THE TRANSCENDENTALISTS, LED BY THOREAU AND RALPH WALDO EMERSON,
ESTABLISHED THE FIRST MAJOR AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL MOVEMENT. AFTER THE
CIVIL WAR, CHARLES SANDERS PEIRCE AND THEN WILLIAM JAMES AND JOHN
DEWEY WERE LEADERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRAGMATISM. IN THE 20TH
CENTURY, THE WORK OF W. V. O. QUINE AND RICHARD RORTY, AND LATER NOAM
CHOMSKY, BROUGHT ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY TO THE FORE OF AMERICAN
PHILOSOPHICAL ACADEMIA. JOHN RAWLS AND ROBERT NOZICK LED A REVIVAL OF
POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY. CORNEL WEST AND JUDITH BUTLER HAVE LED A
CONTINENTAL TRADITION IN AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ACADEMIA. GLOBALLY
INFLUENTIAL CHICAGO SCHOOL ECONOMISTS LIKE MILTON FRIEDMAN, JAMES M.
BUCHANAN, AND THOMAS SOWELL HAVE TRANSCENDED DISCIPLINE TO IMPACT
VARIOUS FIELDS IN SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY.[505][506]

IN THE VISUAL ARTS, THE HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL WAS A MID-19TH-CENTURY
MOVEMENT IN THE TRADITION OF EUROPEAN NATURALISM. THE REALIST
PAINTINGS OF THOMAS EAKINS ARE NOW WIDELY CELEBRATED. THE 1913 ARMORY
SHOW IN NEW YORK CITY, AN EXHIBITION OF EUROPEAN MODERNIST ART,
SHOCKED THE PUBLIC AND TRANSFORMED THE U.S. ART SCENE.[507] GEORGIA
O'KEEFFE, MARSDEN HARTLEY, AND OTHERS EXPERIMENTED WITH NEW,
INDIVIDUALISTIC STYLES. MAJOR ARTISTIC MOVEMENTS SUCH AS THE ABSTRACT
EXPRESSIONISM OF JACKSON POLLOCK AND WILLEM DE KOONING AND THE POP ART
OF ANDY WARHOL AND ROY LICHTENSTEIN DEVELOPED LARGELY IN THE UNITED
STATES. THE TIDE OF MODERNISM AND THEN POSTMODERNISM HAS BROUGHT FAME
TO AMERICAN ARCHITECTS SUCH AS FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT, PHILIP JOHNSON, AND
FRANK GEHRY.


TIMES SQUARE IN NEW YORK CITY, THE HUB OF THE BROADWAY THEATER
DISTRICT[508] ONE OF THE FIRST MAJOR PROMOTERS OF AMERICAN THEATER WAS
IMPRESARIO P. T. BARNUM, WHO BEGAN OPERATING A LOWER MANHATTAN
ENTERTAINMENT COMPLEX IN 1841. THE TEAM OF HARRIGAN AND HART PRODUCED
A SERIES OF POPULAR MUSICAL COMEDIES IN NEW YORK STARTING IN THE LATE
1870S. IN THE 20TH CENTURY, THE MODERN MUSICAL FORM EMERGED ON
BROADWAY; THE SONGS OF MUSICAL THEATER COMPOSERS SUCH AS IRVING
BERLIN, COLE PORTER, AND STEPHEN SONDHEIM HAVE BECOME POP STANDARDS.
PLAYWRIGHT EUGENE O'NEILL WON THE NOBEL LITERATURE PRIZE IN 1936;
OTHER ACCLAIMED U.S. DRAMATISTS INCLUDE MULTIPLE PULITZER PRIZE
WINNERS TENNESSEE WILLIAMS, EDWARD ALBEE, AND AUGUST WILSON.

THOUGH LITTLE KNOWN AT THE TIME, CHARLES IVES'S WORK OF THE 1910S
ESTABLISHED HIM AS THE FIRST MAJOR U.S. COMPOSER IN THE CLASSICAL
TRADITION, WHILE EXPERIMENTALISTS SUCH AS HENRY COWELL AND JOHN CAGE
CREATED A DISTINCTIVE AMERICAN APPROACH TO CLASSICAL COMPOSITION.
AARON COPLAND AND GEORGE GERSHWIN DEVELOPED A NEW SYNTHESIS OF POPULAR
AND CLASSICAL MUSIC. CHOREOGRAPHERS ISADORA DUNCAN AND MARTHA GRAHAM
HELPED CREATE MODERN DANCE, WHILE GEORGE BALANCHINE AND JEROME ROBBINS
WERE LEADERS IN 20TH-CENTURY BALLET. AMERICANS HAVE LONG BEEN
IMPORTANT IN THE MODERN ARTISTIC MEDIUM OF PHOTOGRAPHY, WITH MAJOR
PHOTOGRAPHERS INCLUDING ALFRED STIEGLITZ, EDWARD STEICHEN, AND ANSEL
ADAMS.

FOOD MAIN ARTICLE: CUISINE OF THE UNITED STATES

APPLE PIE IS A FOOD COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH AMERICAN CUISINE.
MAINSTREAM AMERICAN CUISINE IS SIMILAR TO THAT IN OTHER WESTERN
COUNTRIES. WHEAT IS THE PRIMARY CEREAL GRAIN WITH ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS
OF GRAIN PRODUCTS MADE OF WHEAT FLOUR[509] AND MANY DISHES USE
INDIGENOUS INGREDIENTS, SUCH AS TURKEY, VENISON, POTATOES, SWEET
POTATOES, CORN, SQUASH, AND MAPLE SYRUP WHICH WERE CONSUMED BY NATIVE
AMERICANS AND EARLY EUROPEAN SETTLERS.[510] THESE HOME GROWN FOODS ARE
PART OF A SHARED NATIONAL MENU ON ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST POPULAR
HOLIDAYS; THANKSGIVING, WHEN SOME AMERICANS MAKE TRADITIONAL FOODS TO
CELEBRATE THE OCCASION.[511]


ROASTED TURKEY IS A TRADITIONAL MENU ITEM OF AN AMERICAN THANKSGIVING
DINNER.[512] CHARACTERISTIC DISHES SUCH AS APPLE PIE, FRIED CHICKEN,
PIZZA, HAMBURGERS, AND HOT DOGS DERIVE FROM THE RECIPES OF VARIOUS
IMMIGRANTS. FRENCH FRIES, MEXICAN DISHES SUCH AS BURRITOS AND TACOS,
AND PASTA DISHES FREELY ADAPTED FROM ITALIAN SOURCES ARE WIDELY
CONSUMED.[513] AMERICANS GENERALLY PREFER COFFEE TO TEA.[514]
MARKETING BY U.S. INDUSTRIES IS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING ORANGE
JUICE AND MILK UBIQUITOUS BREAKFAST BEVERAGES.[515][516]

AMERICAN EATING HABITS OWE A GREAT DEAL TO THAT OF THEIR BRITISH
CULINARY ROOTS WITH SOME VARIATIONS. EVEN THOUGH AMERICAN LANDS COULD
GROW NEWER VEGETABLES ENGLAND COULD NOT, MOST COLONIST WOULD NOT EAT
THESE NEW FOODS UNTIL ACCEPTED BY EUROPEANS.[517] OVER TIME AMERICAN
FOODS CHANGED TO A POINT THAT FOOD CRITIC, JOHN L. HESS STATED IN
1972: "OUR FOUNDING FATHERS WERE AS FAR SUPERIOR TO OUR PRESENT
POLITICAL LEADERS IN THE QUALITY OF THEIR FOOD AS THEY WERE IN THE
QUALITY OF THEIR PROSE AND INTELLIGENCE".[518]

THE AMERICAN FAST FOOD INDUSTRY, THE WORLD'S LARGEST,[519] PIONEERED
THE DRIVE-THROUGH FORMAT IN THE 1940S.[520] FAST FOOD CONSUMPTION HAS
SPARKED HEALTH CONCERNS. DURING THE 1980S AND 1990S, AMERICANS'
CALORIC INTAKE ROSE 24%;[513] FREQUENT DINING AT FAST FOOD OUTLETS IS
ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS CALL THE AMERICAN
"OBESITY EPIDEMIC".[521] HIGHLY SWEETENED SOFT DRINKS ARE WIDELY
POPULAR, AND SUGARED BEVERAGES ACCOUNT FOR NINE PERCENT OF AMERICAN
CALORIC INTAKE.[522]

HAVE EVOLVED OUT OF EUROPEAN PRACTICES, BASKETBALL, VOLLEYBALL,
SKATEBOARDING, AND SNOWBOARDING ARE AMERICAN INVENTIONS, SOME OF WHICH
HAVE BECOME POPULAR IN OTHER COUNTRIES. LACROSSE AND SURFING AROSE
